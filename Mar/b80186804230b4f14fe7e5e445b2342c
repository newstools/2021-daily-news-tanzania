THE IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, has appointed Amena Arif as its new Country Manager for Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, and Malawi, effective immediately. In her new role, Ms Arif will help IFC strengthen the private sector, create jobs and opportunities, and help businesses and economies in the region recover from the effects of Covid-19. “I am excited to take up this new position at IFC and look forward to working in such a dynamic region. “East Africa’s private sector has proved resilient, including through the Covid-19 crisis, but it can be even a more powerful engine of growth going forward, delivering equitable and sustainable growth,” Ms Arif said. Ms Arif, a Pakistani national, joined IFC almost a decade ago after building a career in commercial banking with Citibank and ABN AMRO Bank. Most recently, she served as IFC’s Country Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, based in Colombo, where she helped grow IFC’s portfolio and deepen its impact. As IFC Country Manager for East Africa and Malawi, Arif will be based in Nairobi. She succeeds Manuel Moses, who moved to a new role outside IFC after successfully serving as IFC East Africa Country Manager for five years. “Her combination of skills and experience will prove invaluable in a region that has made excellent progress strengthening its private sector, but that today faces numerous challenges, including from Covid-19 and climate change,”said Jumoke Jagun-Dokunmu, IFC’s Regional Director for Eastern Africa. IFC’s focus in East Africa includes bridging infrastructure gap in housing and healthcare, improving transport and energy infrastructure, boosting agricultural productivity, and supporting businesses affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in post Covid-19 recovery phase.
