THE Minister for Livestock and Fisheries, Mr Mashimba Ndaki who is also Maswa West Constituency Member of Parliament has directed Maswa District Commissioner (DC) Mr Aswege Kaminyoge to monitor closely use of 8m/- he released to construct two dispensaries in the area. He issued the directive during his recent two- day tour to the constituency to inspect development projects, adding that the money was also part of the residents’ contributions. The minister noted the money should fund roofing Funika village Dispensary in Isanga Ward, saying: “Having seen their efforts towards setting up a health centre, I handed over the money to village leadership, specifically to purchase timber and iron sheets to finish the construction, but I am surprised only 24 pieces of iron sheets out of 168 are accounted for. Where is the rest of the money, where are other building materials….I ask you the DC to go for immediate follow-ups and let us know the secret behind this.” “The villagers also contributed 3m/- in my presence. I need to know where the money has gone and take legal measures against any fraudulent.” In response, Funika village Executive Officer, Mr Jeremiah Misonga, admitted to have received the money, saying it was spent as per the plan. The Minister also visited another dispensary project at Isanga village, where he donated 100 bags of cement, saying they should hasten construction of a Ward for expectant mothers. On his part, the DC directed the Police in the area to detain the village executive officer, for further interrogations, saying: “We need detailed information over these 100 bags of cement.”
