He said that the region is working hard to get more 14 per cent for rural areas, as well as more 11 per cent for urban areas so as to reach the nation’s target of reaching all individuals with the services of clean and safe water. On the other hand, Ndikilo told District Commissioners, District Executive Directors, Members of Parliament and officials from Rural and Urban Water Sanitation Agency (RUWASA) who attended the meeting to supervise the projects as intended. “Since our government has made its intention to solve all water challenges in the country, we are expecting to receive more funds for facilitating other coming water projects. I am taking this time to remind you to make thorough supervision of the projects in your areas and make sure that they meet standards and are completed in time,” he insisted. Apart from that, Ndikilo called for the community to be fully involved in the whole issue of protecting water sources all over the region which he said is very vital in ensuring availability of clean and safe water.
