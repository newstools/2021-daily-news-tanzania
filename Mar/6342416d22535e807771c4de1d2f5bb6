THE exchange rate was stable throughout the first half of 2020/21, recording a year-on-year depreciation of 0.4 per cent, compared with 0.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019. According to the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) Monetary Policy Statement Mid-Year Review 2020/21, the outturn was reinforced by low inflationary environment, prudent monetary and fiscal policies, subdued increase in global oil prices, and moderate current account deficit. The BoT also took measures to improve transparency in foreign exchange dealings to ensure orderly market conditions and facilitated repatriation of physical foreign currency. The exchange rate is expected to remain stable in the remainder of 2020/21, supported by favourable macroeconomic conditions and policies. During the period under review, the inflation remained low in most economies during July to December last year, driven by several factors, including subdued demand amid Covid-19 pandemic, low energy prices and slowdown in food prices. Inflation remained stable, averaging 3.2 per cent during July to December last year period, compared with 3.7 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019. The inflation outturn was within the target band of 3-5 per cent for 2020/21, and EAC and SADC convergence criteria of utmost 8.0 per cent and between 3-7 per cent, respectively. The realisation of low and stable inflation was mainly attributable to adequate domestic food supply, low oil prices, stable exchange rate, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The benign inflation environment witnessed in the first half of 2020/21 is expected to continue in the remainder of 2020/21. In the EAC region, inflation rate was 5.2 per cent, within the convergence criteria of utmost 8.0 per cent, but higher than 3.2 per cent in the corresponding period in 2019. In the SADC region, all the countries realised inflation rate within the convergence criteria of 3-7 per cent, except for Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 2021, inflation is projected to remain subdued in most countries, albeit edging up owing to recovery in demand and energy prices. In advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies, inflation is projected at 1.3 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively. In SSA, inflation is expected to decrease to 7.9 per cent in 2021 from 10.6 per cent in 2020, attributable to stability of food prices because of undisrupted supply chain.
