Dozens of protesters have attacked a minibus carrying Argentina's President, Alberto Fernández, in the country's Patagonia region. Crowds gathered around Mr Fernández and threw stones and punched his vehicle outside a community centre in the southern province of Chubut. The president was visiting an area devastated by forest fires, which have killed one person and injured others. But the protest was against plans to resume open-pit mining in Chubut. The demonstrators were angry at government proposals to allow large-scale projects to begin again in the region, which is rich in gold, silver and uranium, Clarín newspaper reported.
