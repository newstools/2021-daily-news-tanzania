MWANZA Press Club (MPC) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with International World Women’s Group (IWPG) to run a-two-month training for journalists, focusing on how best to craft peace related stories. Themed: "The role of Media in spreading peace in Tanzania and the world” is an online training following the corona pandemic, said the IWPG Coordinator, Ms Thithiwan White recently during an orientation course. "The media is a very crucial instrument spearheading peace in Tanzania and the world at large. Journalists should write stories on building the foundations of peace so that the world can be a safer place away from hatred and hostility, which delay development in society. We all know the power of the media in spreading information, let us make the world safer" she said. She said the trained journalists will be ambassadors of peace as they are on the right position to communicate with the world. Peace promotion should include the fight against gender based violence related acts, such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and rape among others. MPC Chairperson, Mr Edwin Soko called for commitment from the training beneficiaries, saying that peace issues are a priority of all countries worldwide. He extended his gratitude to IWPG, urging the organisation to conduct similar training on a regular basis so that all journalists can have the important knowledge on peace issues. Director of the Union of Tanzania Press Clubs (UTPC), Mr Abubakar Kharsan praised the initiative (MoU signing), stating that in recognition of the training's importance, all participants will be awarded with special certificates. Mr Kharsan urged all members of the press club to apply for such capacity building training in a bid to enhance the peace worldwide.
