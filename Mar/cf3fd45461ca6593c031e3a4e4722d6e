There was a sombre mood and a dark cloud of grief hovering over Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma on Monday morning after the arrival of a casket carrying the body departed Tanzania’s iconic leader, Dr John Magufuli. Some leaders and wananchi, who arrived early at the full packed stadium to bid their last respects, failed to hold back their tears upon the arrival of the escorted hearse carrying the casket. Special parades assembled for the farewell to symbolize that the gone leader was the Army’s Commander-In-Chief. Presiding chairman of Southern African Development Community (SADC) who doubled President of Mozambique Felippe Nyusi, African Union (AU) chairman Felix Tshekedi (DRC President) attended the event. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta who also doubles also represented East African Community (EAC) as the block’s presiding chairman.
