The South Sudanese military has announced the death of three generals who died after becoming ill with Covid-19. It identified the three as David Manyot Barach, Elijah Alier Ayom and Mabior Maket. Burials would be organised by a committee in collaboration with the families of the deceased, the military said. Chief of Defence Forces Gen Johnson Juma Okot has urged all soldiers to adhere to Covid-19 safety measures, according to the military spokesman Brig Gen Santo Domic Chol. Over the last two weeks, two prominent scholars at the University of Juba have also died after contracting coronavirus - bringing the number of deaths from the pandemic to 95. In total, 8,144 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in South Sudan. The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) say South Sudan is witnessing a surge in cases because of poor adherence to safety measures like social distancing and the wearing of face masks.
