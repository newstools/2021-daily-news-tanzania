BENJAMIN Mkapa Hospital (BMH) has introduced new medical service in a wide range of specialty care it offers. Beginning last week, dermatology care has been available at the institution on Thursdays and Fridays. BMH dermatology specialist, Dr Elias Mayala on Monday said services they offer include skin exams and evaluation, as well as treatment of any skin condition to all patients of all ages. “We are pleased to welcome residents of Dodoma, and the Central Zone as well as neighbouring regions to get dermatology services at the BMH. We conduct skin exams and treatment different skin ailments,” further said the dermatologis, while explaining that dermatology is branch of medicine that deals with human skin. However, BMH remains the only health facility in the country that performs kidney transplant with assistance from local specialists. In its 400 capacity bed, the hospital started kidney transplant under the auspices of Japan-based Tokushukui Medical Group in 2018. So far, it has performed at least 12 kidney transplants and becoming the second health facility after the Muhimbili National Hospital to perform such surgery.
