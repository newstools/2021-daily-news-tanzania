THE Fanikiwa Microfinance has directed its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes towards protecting environment and creating a better learning environment in schools. The company told ‘Daily News’ recently that it has begun campaign to plant trees in schools aimed at enabling pupils and students in primary and secondary schools to have conducive environment for studying. Fanikiwa’s Managing Director, Mr Shauri Serenda, said the initiative has started in Arusha and Dar es Salaam and would further spread to other regions. “Apart from empowering Tanzanians economically through providing loans to raise their income, we have started this initiative in supporting the government protecting environment and improving education,” he said. Recently, in collaboration with environmentalists, the company planted about 200 trees at Matosa Secondary School in Goba and expects that the trees would help students get shed and fruits Mr Serenda noted, the school with over 1000 students, was in dire need of shed trees so that students could have places for self-study outside classrooms. The Fanikiwa programme involved environmental stakeholders from both the government and non-governmental organisations. Some of NGOs engaged in the initiative are the Forum CC, Human Dignity and Environmental Care Foundation (HUDEFO) and Association of Geographers and Environmental Managers (AGEM). Director of the HUDEFO, Ms Sarah Pima, said her organisation provides consultancy on environmental issues, calling on other financial institutions and private sector to participate in initiatives to protect environment. “We want the issue of behavioural change become priority…we should teach young generation while in schools,” she argued. AGEM Chairperson Mr Tidoson Cleophace, said it was important to engage pupils in activities of planting trees at their schools so that they learn by practice how to plant trees and be aware of importance of planting trees.
