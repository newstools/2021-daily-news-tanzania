EVANGELICAL Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) Diocese of Tanganyika, Rukwa and Katavi Bishop Ambele Mwaipopo and veteran politician, Dr Chrisant Mzindakaya have called on Tanzanians to maintain peace and never resort to political squabbles during these mourning days. Rev Bishop Mwaipopo, who is also Chairman of Rukwa Peace Committee, made the appeal in an exclusive interview with the ‘Sunday News’ saying: “Tanzanians, regardless of our religious background, tribe, political party, must remain united and calm as we mourn the sudden demise of our beloved President John Magufuli. “At no point and time did God ever abandon his children because, He is always a loving and caring God…we will forever remember Dr Magufuli for his commitment to serving the nation as Head of the State. May his soul rest in eternal peace.” Elaborating, he eulogised Dr Magufuli as a tireless hardworking leader, who deserved respect also posthumously. For his part, Rukwa Region Chief Sheikh Rashid Akilimali appealed to Tanzanians to ensure the good deeds and projects Dr Magufuli had initiated were completed. “Regardless of our differences, we should always remember Dr Magufuli for his commitment and his love for Tanzanians,” he pointed out. Commenting, Dr Mzindakaya said the sad news destabilised him: “Dr Magufuli’s reign witnessed projects being completed and economic growth everywhere in the country. This outstanding performance did not come overnight, but as a result of his commitments. He initiated some major flagship projects such as Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), Julius Nyerere Hydropower Station (JNHS), flyovers, bridges, roads and ports, hence great economic growth.”
