TANZANIA Distilleries Limited, the producer of Konyagi, have decided to change the look of its brand by inscribing a logo of a woman with raised hands as part of recognizing women’s efforts in transforming lives in the country. Speaking to reporters at the launch of the logo in Dar es Salaam, Konyagi Brand Manager, Pamela Kikuli said that the logo change goes hand in hand with celebration of the International Women’s Day. “We recognize continued efforts by the women of this country in participating in day to day activities in their move to transform their lives in all corners of life,” said Ms Kikuli. She said that women have in recent years been major contributors of the country’s economy as several others own mega companies, apart from their formal and informal involvement in other development activities which boost the country’s economy. And to support the women’s moves, Konyagi has decided to change the logo of its bottle to portray a woman’s image of bravery. She added that what has changed is just the logo and a message wishing all women in Tanzania a happy International Women’s Day. “I therefore urge our consumers to continue using the drink without any worries and enjoy the unique and high quality beverage,” said Ms Kikuli. Equally, she noted that Konyagi is a gin-based drink that was first brewed in 1977 and that its taste will remain the same.
