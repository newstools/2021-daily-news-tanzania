Kenya will observe a 7-day period of national mourning in honour of fallen President John Magufuli. “On behalf of the government and people of Kenya, I convey our sincere condolences to the entire Magufuli family. Africa and the world has lost an illustrious leader whose vision, passion and immense leadership, propelled the nation of Tanzania forward,” Uhuru said. In his address on Thursday, President Uhuru Kenyatta also directed that the East African Community (EAC) and Kenyan flags fly half-mast starting today until sunset on the day Magufuli will be laid to rest. The flags will also fly half-mast at all public buildings, grounds, and all Kenya’s diplomatic missions abroad.
