THE Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Services and Community Development has directed the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) to secure rights of airing local leagues and Taifa Stars matches as among ways of boosting their earnings. Such a call was issued on Saturday by the Chairman of the Committee, Stanslaus Nyongo after visiting the TBC offices located in Mikocheni in Dar es Salam. Nyongo pointed out that by showing the local leagues TBC can be in a better position to accumulate revenue which will not only benefit them but also the country as a whole. “The fact that other broadcasters are airing out the local league and matches do not benefit the government in any way as it would have been if it was TBC doing this. “TBC in collaboration with the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports should ensure that they are devising a plan of taking advantage of this crucial opportunity,” said Nyongo. He observed that the move will enable TBC to boost their revenues and operate independently free from support and in turn contribute to the government’s coffers. The Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Innocent Bashungwa responding to the committee said he had directed the TBC Director General and the Permanent Secretary of the ministry to start working on the matter. Minister Bashungwa disclosed that if the move is successful, billions of money can be generated by TBC due to the promotion of sports. On his part, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Hassan Abbas noted that they are going to invite necessary stakeholders to go through the specific guidelines and requirements needed before airing the leagues. TBC Director General, Dr Ayoub Rioba pledged to work on the directives and recommendations from the committee.
