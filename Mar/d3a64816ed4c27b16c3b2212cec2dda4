MINISTER for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, has issued a 10-day ultimatum to the management of Mtwara Gas Plant to repair two faulty machines to ensure steady power generation in Mtwara and Lindi regions. Dr Kalemani issued the ultimatum after inspecting the only power plant generating power in Lindi and Mtwara regions. He told the plant manager and workers to complete the work or else they would be replaced. "I direct the manager of the plant, operators and all workers to ensure the machines are fixed within 10 days, failure of which they will be transferred to other places and more serious people will take over the management of the plant,‚Äù he stressed. The minister said that the faulty power machines were among the four that had to be restored after they broke down since November last year. The management of the power plant had told the minister that the repairs of the two machines would be completed by the end of this month. Dr Kalemani said he had made several follow-ups to ensure the power was restored, including forming a team of experts who would tour the plant to ensure the machines were restored for steady power generation for Mtwara and Lindi regions. Commenting on power production in Mtwara and Lindi regions, the minister said power generating facility had seen an increase in power generation from 22MW to 30.4MW for the two regions. "As of last year, we had power equipment able to produce only 22MW. The government gave the directive to purchase the two machines to meet the needs of Mtwara and Lindi regions. The two machines were bought in November and fixed, enabling the facility to generate 30.4MW," he said.
