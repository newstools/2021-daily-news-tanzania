The Parliamentary Standing Committee in Industry, Trade and Environment has called on the government to invest in livestock vaccine industries in order to cut down various expenses incurred by locals. Members of the committee under chairmanship of David Kihenjile advised this after inspecting various projects in Coast and Dar es Salaam regions. Speaking after inspecting construction of the Hester Bioscience Limited factory in Kibaha, Mr Kihenjile suggested: "It is good to invest heavily in disease prevention in the country." After completion of the project of the 42bn/- project, the vaccines factory will produce 37 animal vaccines. Meanwhile, the committeeâ€™s vice chairman Eric Shigongo commended the government for inviting investors to build Africa's largest livestock vaccine industry in Kibaha. He said the factory would provide jobs for Tanzanians while the products will be affordable for pastoralists. Meanwhile, the Minister of Industry and Trade, Geoffrey Mwambe also commended Hester Biosciences Africa for investing in Africa's largest veterinary vaccine factory, insisting that the government will continue to invest in Tanzania Bio - Tech products ltd (TBPL) which produces mosquito repellents.
