THE Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (Ruwasa) has increased clean and safe water supply services in Maswa District from 69 to 73 per cent. Ruwasa Manager Boniphace William said yesterday during his tour to inspect water projects in the district that the improvement had come about after the implementation of four pay for results (PfoR) projects worth 1.3bn/- in Isageghe, Masela, Ilamata, Isulilo-Ngongwa and Mwamihanza. “The projects have been implemented through what we call ‘force account’ through which about 17,500 out 379,000 of Maswa residents benefit from these projects. "A force account approach plays a big role in project implementation in terms of cost saving compared to engagement of contractors. The work is 100 per cent complete and Ruwasa wants to ensure all villages in this district are covered,” said the manager. He further revealed that there were more ongoing water projects in Maswa implemented through the National Water Fund in Nyashimba, Muhida, Nguluguli, Mwamanenge and Sengwa villages. According to him, Sengwa Project gets water from Lake Victoria through Kishapu District in Shinyanga Region. Maswa District Commissioner Aswege Kaminyoge directed the protection of all water sources in the area. The DC at the same time banned any human activities near water sources to protect the areas and make them sustainable so that they may continue providing safe and clean water throughout the year. “All areas with water projects must have title deeds. The same applies to all public owned institutions located in this district. This will help, among other things, avoid any possible land conflict in the future. Water sources must be protected at any cost for current and future generations,” noted the DC.
