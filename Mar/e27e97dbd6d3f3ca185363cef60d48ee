A sombre mood engulfed Tanzania’s commercial city of Dar es Salaam Saturday as a hearse carrying the body of the former Tanzania’s President John Magufuli made its way to Uhuru Stadium for leaders and residents to pay their last respects. Thousands of the city’s residents lined up along roads as the procession which started at St Peters Catholic Church passed through Morocco, Kinondoni, Magomeni, Kigogo, Boma, Machinga Complex, Chang’ombe, Keko, DUCE to the destination. Emotional scenes with several people break down, other paying tributes in a special way by throwing roses, laying down their fabrics just to show respect to their fallen hero. President Magufuli's body was earlier brought to the St Peter's Catholic Church around 8am this morning from the States House where the requiem mass took place. Other residents of Dodoma, Zanzibar Island, Mwanza and Geita will also get an opportunity to bid farewell to their iconic leader. According to President Samia Suluhu Hassan, Dr Magufuli passed away on March 17, 2021 at about 6pm at Mzena Hospital in Dar es Salaam where he was hospitalised after suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation, a condition he had fought for more than a decade.
