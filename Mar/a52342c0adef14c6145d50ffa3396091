CHATO District residents have been urged to maintain peace as other citizens and visitors pour into the area to pay their last respects and burial of the fallen leader, President John Magufuli on 26th March. Making the appeal, Chato District Commissioner (DC) Engineer Charles Kabeho in Geita region further said all preparations for the burial are now complete, adding: “Members of the public should maintain solidarity, unity, peace and love in this mourning period for our be - loved Dr Magufuli. He was our President and above all a villager here.” He further said according to the timetable issued by the newly sown-in President Samia Suluhu Hassan, Chato residents and neighbouring areas will have a chance to pay their last respects on 25th this month. Elaborating, he noted the condolence book for the public to sign was available in his office, saying: “You are all welcome to the District Office and sign the condolence book. Again, I would like to inform the public that we are well organized, security-wise we are on the ground.” On his part, the District Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)’ Chairman, Rafael Masambo, called upon other leaders especially during this mourning period to start strategizing how they will implement projects the late president left unfinished. Mr Masambo further said completing the projects would be a great homage to the late president posthumously, adding: “He had us in mind, and we should therefore, reciprocate and this goal can only be achieved with peace prevailing within us.”
