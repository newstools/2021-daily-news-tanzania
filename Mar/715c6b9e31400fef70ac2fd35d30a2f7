STANDARD Chartered Bank Tanzania (SCB) is celebrating advancing gender equality in the workplace and gains made working with International Finance Corporation (IFC) Finance2Equal Tanzania programme. IFC has been partnering with SCB under its ‘Finance2Equal’ financial services sector partnership programme to increase women’s participation as leaders, employees, customers and entrepreneurs since April 2019. SCB is celebrating this in honour of this year’s International Women’s Day theme ‘Choose to Challenge’. In November last year IFC conducted a survey for a case study on SCB’s gender equality and policies in the workplace and the findings have been significantly positive. “Preliminary results from case studies indicate that SCB is creating a culture that supports gender equality from having one third of its board members and executive committee members being women to having a strategy focused on catapulting more women to leadership positions,” said Ms Anne Kabugi, IFC Regional Gender Lead for Africa. Over 50 per cent of the bank’s staff participated in an IFC survey, which focused on applying global gender equality best practices and achieving local success. Commenting on initial results, SCB CEO Sanjay Rughani said, “I am happy to note the initial results presented by IFC on the gender survey that they’ve done on the bank. These preliminary results represent the significant progress we have made our diversity and inclusion agenda.
