SERENGETI Breweries Ltd (SBL) has given over 70 new scholarships to students studying agricultural courses in local colleges. The scholarships cover school fees and other academic expenses for students’ entire study period. This is the second year in a row that SBL supports bright students from underprivileged backgrounds to access college education in agriculture. Last year, 40 students were offered this opportunity as the brewer unveiled its agri-industry scholarship programme known as Kilimo-Viwanda. The Kilimo-Viwanda programme is also meant to complement the government effort to strengthen an existing pool of agricultural experts in the country, according to SBL Managing Director Mark Ocitti. Announcing a group of 15 scholarship beneficiaries from Kaole Wazazi College of Agriculture based in Bagamoyo, Mr Ocitti also took the opportunity to state how the company’s support for agricultural development extended to 400 local farmers who he said last year supplied SBL with 17,000 tonnes of grain equivalent to 70 per cent of its raw material requirements. Kaole Wazazi College of Agriculture Principal Sinani Simba present at the event commended SBL for the programme, appealing to other significant stakeholders to support the agricultural sector’s development. Agricultural training experts are among the priorities spelt out in the agricultural sector development programme (phase II). It is a prerequisite to increasing productivity and income generation for local farmers, according to Mr Simba.
