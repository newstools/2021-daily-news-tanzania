TANZANIA Amateur Volleyball Association (TAVA) has joined other sports stakeholders to mourn the death of Tanzania President John Magufuli who died in Dar es Salaam March 17, 2021. Expressing volleyball fraternity’s heartfelt fillings from Moshi in Kilimanjaro Region yesterday, TAVA Secretary General Alfred Selengia said the country and sports have lost a great leader. Selengia explained: “He has become a model leader who puts patriotism first. He expresses his desire to change the sports sector into a better position than before.” Adding, he said Magufuli made it clear that he did not want to see national teams turned ‘madman head’ that everyone use to learn shaving. In short he was angered to our team being constant losers. “His statement encouraged and motivated us to fight and defend this nation’s dignity, we are heading to the right decision through his leadership,” he added. He said that Magufuli encouragement helped TAVA leaders, and since then they have fought hard for the national teams and in particular the U21 girls' beach volleyball team. Selengia said under Magufuli tenure the girl’s Under- 21 team for the first time won Africa Zone Five Champions. The team has also finished fifth in the African Championships and qualified to play in the World Cup for the first time. “Our national men's beach volleyball team also won Zone Five Champions two years ago and now we are at the second round of the Olympic qualifiers,” he said. Selengia stressed that Magufuli did his best and the best to lead the way.
