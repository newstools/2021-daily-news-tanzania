THE United Bank for Africa Tanzania Limited (UBA) has organised a dialogue discussion with staff members and customers on various strategies that will help families maintain a normal work life balance. Speaking in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday during a panel discussion which marked International Women Day for Bank of Africa (UBA) Tanzania with the theme ‘Gender Work Life balance’, the banks Head of Marketing and Corporate Communications, Brendansia Kileo said in maintaining a balance of social and working life, they decided to have their male colleagues give their opinions and views by sharing various initiatives used to support women in attaining the desired balance. "We have included men to be able to get the ideas they are thinking of in partnership and to support women so that they can fulfill their dreams and responsibilities when they are at home and at work," she said. "Within the society we see many women failing to fulfill their dreams or overwhelmed by work responsibilities, many men do not provide the necessary co-operation to ensure those dreams are achieved, but as UBA Bank Tanzania, we choose to challenge a cooperation between the genders so that they can work together collaboratively to achieve their dreams and solve various challenges that arise in their lives and develop the wheel of success, " added Kileo. UBA Bank Tanzania Chief Finance Officer, Mr Chomete Hussein said that in order to develop a work life balance, the male gender need to be more cooperative and assist their counterparts in their social roles without stereotyping the chores or roles by assisting each other, which makes their responsibilities less a burden and ease their balance. He added that men, as head of families have the obligation to ensure that the mother can achieve the goals and dreams of her life. UBA Chief Operations Officer, Ms Flavia Kiyanga said a mother is a person who has a great responsibility to the family because in African tradition, it includes looking after the house, children and everything needed in the family to ensure its wellbeing. The UBA Bank Tanzania Head of the Public Sector, Mr Mathias Ninga said father and mother are both the heads of the family, so there is more of a balance if the two genders agree on equal responsibilities to the family as opposed to the former notion that the father/male are the only financial sponsors of the family. All family members must be patient in their daily lives due to challenges they face, so it is good to listen and consult to make sure they achieve their goals, it should be understood that even though a mother may not be financially contributing to the family, she devotes valuable time, patience, creativity and experience to ensure things are running smoothly in the family.
