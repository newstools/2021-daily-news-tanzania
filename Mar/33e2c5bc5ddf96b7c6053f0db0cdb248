THE Parliament has vowed to closely follow up and monitor the implementation of all projects and other commitments made by President John Magufuli as a way to cherish his contribution to the nation. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, National Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai said they were shocked by the death of fifth phase President on Wednesday evening. He described President Magufuli as a committed, hardworking, fighter and a visionary leader who wanted to steer the country’s development and its people to the next level. “We have lost a national fighter and we pledge to live by his vision. We will ensure that all projects he had initiated are completed as planned. His speeches he delivered on many occasions will be our working tool to guide us,” said Mr Ndugai. Following the death of President Magufuli, Speaker Ndugai recalled back to Dodoma all parliamentary standing committees to look into the implementation of various development projects endorsed in the 2020/21 fiscal year. Mr Ndugai said President Magufuli had shown exemplary performance during the time he served the nation, leaving everlasting marks in transport infrastructure, water projects, education and health, among other sectors. Mr Ndugai offered his condolence message to Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan, the widow, Ms Janeth Magufuli, and the entire bereaved family, friends, Chato residents and Tanzanians at large. “I did not sleep when I received the bad news of President Magufuli’s passing on. He closely worked with the legislature for smooth discharging of our duties,” added Speaker Ndugai
