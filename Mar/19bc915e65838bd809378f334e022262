THE national Under-17 football team, dubbed Serengeti Boys will today play their Ugandan counterparts in a friendly match in Marrakech as part of preparations for Total U-17 Africa Cup of Nations finals to be held in Rabat, Morocco. Speaking after arriving in Marrakech safely on Saturday, the team’s head coach U-17  Hababuu Ali said yesterday that after playing Uganda, they will also leave to Rabat, the capital city of Morocco to play hosts, Morocco tomorrow in another build up before going into a camp. The two crucial build up matches will help the team to make final touches before romping into AFCON’s first match against Nigeria. The annual competition will be starting in nine days time in North Africa and the East Africans will be aiming at making an impression after a poor outing by the U-20 team in Mauritania where they were eliminated in the group stage. This was a couple of weeks after the senior team Taifa Stars also fell in the group stages in the African Nations Championship held in Cameroon. It is the third time the Serengeti Boys will be playing in the competition having featured for the first time in Gabon back in 2017 before taking part again two years later when they hosted it. However, they have not managed to get past the initial group stage. This season, Tanzania have been placed in Group B alongside Nigeria, Algeria and Congo. Group A has Uganda, hosts Morocco, Ivory Coast, and Zambia while Group C is made up of Cameroon, Senegal and South Africa. The Serengeti Boys will begin their campaign in the competition by taking on Nigeria on March 14 before facing Algeria on March 17 and end their group fixtures with a clash against Congo on March 20 - with all matches lined up for Moulay Hassan Stadium. The Afcon tournament, which consists of 12 teams, has been scheduled to start on March 13 and will last until March 31. The venues to host matches are Complexe Moulay El Hassan,  Stade El Bachir in Mohammedia and Stade Père Jégo  located in Casablanca.
