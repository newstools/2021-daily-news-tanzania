THE Dar es Salaam Maritime Institute (DMI) has launched a blue economy book which focuses on how it can contribute to economic growth in the country. The book, entitled “Blue economy is an opportunity and catalyst for development”, has been written by DMI lecturer, Dr Tumaini Gurumo, and was launched recently in Dar es Salaam. Speaking at the launch, Dr Gurumo said the book was expected to provide education to the people of the maritime economy and make them know the opportunities available so that they could get rid of and eradicate poverty. “The book has come at a time when countries and the world at large have seen a significant contribution to economic growth through maritime economy,” she said. She pointed out that the book also aimed at promoting the use of oceans, rivers and lakes as a major source for the production of goods and services in parallel with land. “Our country has also come up with priorities in the maritime economy, including transportation, fishing, tourism, marine mining that encourages people to utilise available resources,” she said. Acting Permanent Secretary (Transport) in the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications, Gabriel Migile said there were many opportunities in the blue economy, while advising the DMI management to continue building and developing professionals who would be important as human resources in the transport sector. “We should use available opportunities in the country to support government efforts through the blue economy,” he said. Trade Mark East Africa (TMEA) Southern Cluster Countries Director of Infrastructure and Transport, Dr Jovin Mwemezi, said water transport as part of the blue economy was important for trade, industry and even foreign exchange earnings, freight forwarding and employment in the country.
