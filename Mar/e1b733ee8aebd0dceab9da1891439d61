Security has been ramped up at the US Capitol in response to "a possible plot to breach" the building. The move was prompted by intelligence that an unnamed militia group planned the attack for 4 March - the day US presidents used to be inaugurated. The House of Representatives cancelled Thursday's session, but the Senate will continue with its agenda. The threat comes two months after the deadly attack on the building by a mob loyal to former President Donald Trump. They breached the Capitol building in January while lawmakers were inside moving to certify Democrat Joe Biden's election victory. Mr Trump still refuses to admit losing the election. The riot saw five people including a police officer killed and shook the foundations of American democracy. The head of the Capitol police force later resigned. Supporters of an unfounded conspiracy theory believe Mr Trump will return to the White House on 4 March. "As of late February, an unidentified group of militia violent extremists discussed plans to take control of the US Capitol and remove Democratic lawmakers on or about 4 March and discussed aspirational plans to persuade thousands to travel to Washington, DC, to participate," a new intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security says.
