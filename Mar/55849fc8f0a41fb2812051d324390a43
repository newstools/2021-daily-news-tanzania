Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto has eulogised Tanzania late President John Magufulias a decisive, bold and fearless visionary. Ruto in his condolence message said Magufuli was always powered by the courage of his convictions. The DP said the late Magufuli easily broke with any orthodoxies in his government and management that he considered unimaginative, inefficient, mediocre or corrupt. “I have learned with great sadness about the passing on of his Excellency President John Pombe Magufuli ... He signaled the commitments of his leadership through highly visible personal interventions,” he said. Ruto said the late president was a strong proponent in word and pioneer in deed of solving African problems with African solutions. "At the same time, the late president was a robust patriot who propagated a model of national pride that was difficult to ignore,” he said. The DP said Magufuli leaves behind a proud legacy of a responsive public service in touch with the people’s need and dedicated to providing efficient solutions to national problems. “He bequeathed Tanzania with historic firsts in the promotion of women’s leadership and decision making,” he said. Ruto said he joins other Kenyans and the East Africa Community in praying for peace and divine solace for Tanzanian people as they confront the painful transition.
