The United States Vice President Kamala Harris has extended her heartfelt congratulatory message on the newly sworn-in Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan. Harris, the first female and black VP in the history of the most powerful nation in the world, joins other world leaders in drumming support for the new Tanzania Head of State. Through her verified twitter handle, the US Ms Harris said: “Sending best wishes to @SuluhuSamia following her swearing in as Tanzania's new President, the first woman to hold the office. The United States stands ready to work with you to strengthen relations between our countries.” Samia Suluhu Hassan was sworn in on Friday and became Tanzania's first female President following the sudden death of John Magufuli who lost battle to heart-related complications known as atrial fibrillation. Mama Samia now becomes the Tanzania’s sixth President and and her ruling CCM is in the verge of endorsing her as the party's national chairperson.
