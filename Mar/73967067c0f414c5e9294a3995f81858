THE Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development is set to take to court chronic land debtors, claiming over 12bn/- land tax. Assistant Commissioner of Lands in the region, Mr Elia Kamiyanda said already 11,000 claim notices had been sent to relevant chronic debtors, with some cases being set to be referred to court in a few days to come. "We start with 736 cases, whose debt is 3bn/-. The debtors are to be taken to court at any time from now. Section 50 of the Land Act, 1999 stipulates that landowners who have not paid land tax will be notified by filing a claim, which will require them, within 14 days to pay rent. If they do not pay, then they will be taken to court as the law provides. “In these 736 cases, we are asking the court to seize all claimed plots and allow them to be given to needy Tanzanians or those willing to pay land tax,” Mr Kamiyanda noted. He added that the Commissioner's Office was proceeding with a public awareness campaign and education while reminding members of the public on land law requirements and the obligation of land ownership to pay due tax. It is further noted that the office keeps on sending claim notices to remind debtors to clear their debts before facing further legal action. "We commend those who immediately respond to our claim notices and clear their debts on time to avoid possible legal measures as it is the case for these 736 charges. We will be taking chronic debtors to court in phases," stressed the commissioner.
