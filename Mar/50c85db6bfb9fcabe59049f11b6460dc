AN elephant, whose value is estimated at 34m/, has been hit and killed by a speeding vehicle in Serengeti National Park, Mara Regional Police Commander Daniel Shillah said on Friday. The accident took place on Wednesday about 8pm on Mwanza-Musoma Road, involving a Toyota Kluger vehicle (T388 DUF), according to him. “The driver ran away and the vehicle was badly damaged. The police are hunting the driver,” said the RPC. Serengeti National Park Head Masana Mwishawa urged drivers to abide by road safety regulations when driving in national parks. “Despite rare accidents to wildlife, the loss caused to government is huge even if it is only one animal is killed,” he noted. “There is a need for the drivers to abide by road safety rules and regulations, especially in speed restricted areas. This is a second road accident since January this year – in the first one, both a hippopotamus and the driver were killed and the vehicle was badly damaged after it overturned several times,” explained Mr Mwishawa. Despite efforts by national park authorities and the Police Force to control speed in or near national parks, game reserves, schools, hospitals, markets or where are crowds of people many drivers hardly abide by road safety rules and regulations. He reiterated that the elephant, which was on its way to drink water from Lake Victoria would not have been killed had the driver adhered to the acceptable 50 speed, in the park. “Speeding is still a major cause of wildlife deaths despite various restrictions we set in various areas of this park. The police have been also camping in Bunda and Busega, specifically for controlling defy drivers who put animal lives at stake. “They just obey when approach police camps and speed after they pass by. Not only wildlife, but defiant drivers have been also costing people’s lives and properties in the national park,” he added.
