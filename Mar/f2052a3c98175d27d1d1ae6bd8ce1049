Government has encouraged Tanzanians to adopt the spirit of investing in their own country instead of relying on foreign investors. Speaking at the launch of a book named “Katavi Region Investment Opportunity” on Wednesday in Katavi Region, the Minister of State in the President’s Office (Investment), Prof Kitila Mkumbo said investment needs determination and people have to be determined to start investing even with a small capital “When we talk about investment, people see it as a big deal, very serious and think that it is just for foreigners, but not so.  Investment is a step that one can take personally or a company can decide to invest into business and finally make a profit," said Minister Kitila Mkumbo Elaborating, Prof. Mkumbo told the public to cast away fear and engage into investing as a way of developing the country. Prof Mkumbo said that the global economy and finance always depends on hardworking people who are willing to save the little they have and invest. "Today's economy depends so much on investment, there must be people who save but also invest” said Prof. Mkumbo.
