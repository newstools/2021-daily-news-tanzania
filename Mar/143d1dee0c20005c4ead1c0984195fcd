According to ATCL Managing Director, Eng Ladislaus Matindi, the first journey will be on 20th this month of a direct flight from Dar es Salaam to Guangzhou City in China. “Passengers are advised to get cleared with Chinese embassy on Covid-19 related issues. Using our modern state of art aircrafts, Boeing 787, ATCL will from March 20 fly to China once a week. “We will be leaving Dar es Salaam every Saturday at 5:00am and land in Guangzhou city and it will depart back to Dar es Salaam and land on the next day Sunday at 5 in the morning. “This will be the longest route the national flag bearer will be making after its revival apart from the Mumbai City route that has been there,” pointed out the Managing Director. Elaborating, Mr Matindi said passengers and cargo transporters were welcomed to prefer ATCL flight, adding: “Let me assure you as travellers and cargo transporters that ATCL will transport you within a very short time of only 11 hours, besides making sure that your cargoes will be safe. “ATCL is profoundly adhering to all set protocols, rules and regulations on air transport set by countries in which we land. This is to ensure safety of people and their properties.” However, he advised intending passengers to ensure they adhere to Covid-19 protocols to be observed as set by the Chinese government. “Travellers will have to secure visa and green health code at Chinese embassy after getting a certificate from the national laboratory showing their Covid-19 tests as negative,” said the Managing Director.
