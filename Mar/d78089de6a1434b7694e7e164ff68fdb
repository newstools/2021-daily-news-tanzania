MISUSE of fishnets is one of the reasons behind illegal fishing, stakeholders in the fishing industry have said during a meeting to discuss protection and participatory management of fishery resources in Lake Victoria. The meeting, chaired by Minister for Livestock and Fisheries, Dr Mashimba Ndaki, brought together stakeholders from the Lake Zone, with participants saying that every water body has its own fishnet sizes, but some dishonest traders have been doing the opposite, deliberately practising illegal fishing. “My permit directs me to produce fishnets whose size fits only Lake Victoria… they cannot be used anywhere else.  It is because every water body/source has its one net size,” the director of the Mwanza-based Fanaka Fishnets Limited Mr Tatinen Rao said. He stressed that every fishnet manufacturer has a permit that directs the size to be produced for a specific water body. “Doing the opposite is to encourage misuse of fishnets that affects ecosystem in various water bodies,” he said. Mr Rao urged the government to set up mechanisms to make sure all fishing tools are thoroughly inspected before being used. A fishermen from Musoma District, Mara Region, Isaya Mushema, supported the proposal, saying that similarly,  all fishing canoes at all fish camps, commonly known as 'Mialo', should be registered, with fishermen reporting to relevant authorities before getting into water, every day, for inspection. Dr Ndaki urged all stakeholders in the sector to make good and profitable use of Lake Victoria, which serves over 4,000,000 people, who engage in fishing activities. He further revealed that over 75 per cent of the fish available in the country comes from Lake Victoria. “We all, therefore, should speak the same language against illegal fishing. Using unauthorised nets means all water products, regardless the size, are to be fished out, leaving the water without any fish,” he said.
