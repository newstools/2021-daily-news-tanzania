CHATO ‘A' Primary School in Geita District, where the late President John Magufuli went to school has turned into a funeral site, with visitors pouring in and pupils eulogizing him as a parent who has left them orphans. According to the Head teacher, Honest Alex, the pupils mostly the ones living with physical disabilities said President Magufuli’s death has robbed them of support he would have handed over to them as his own school. “When he assumed power in 2015, he built us more classrooms and 40 latrine pits. All these infrastructures are friendly to children with special needs. Having observed this comfortable situation, fellow parents with children living with disabilities brought them and the number kept on climbing, but he is physically gone. “The school and surrounding communities therefore have a good reason to mourn, and we believe a lot more were coming,” further said Mr Alex. However, he asked the government to continue setting them a favourable learning environment for the children to study in the school that currently has 1, 200 pupils against projected 3,000 as Dr Magufuli could have done. On her part, the school’s Assistant Head teacher, Ms Miriam Fanuel, said: “President Magufuli preferred hygiene and that is why he set high standards and motivated several pupils, especially girls to like the school. “He wanted and implemented free education that made sure no child remained at home for lack of school fees. Generally, schools’ enrollment kept on rising every year and that addressed illiteracy and promoted children fundamental rights.”
