ABOUT 50,000 mourners from in and outside the country are expected to be in Chato to pay their last respects to former president John Magufuli, Geita regional Commissioner (RC) robert Gabriel said yesterday. The RC said this at a press conference involving CCM leaders and elderly Union members in Chato District. “There will be between 20,000 and 45,000 guests. I have been informed that all hotels in Chato-Geita Town Centre are full as mourners keep on flocking to the region.” Following an increase in the number of mourners, the RC advised those who were still coming to go to Mwanza region for accommodation purposes. Mr Gabriel urged Geita residents to continue being generous and provide accommodation to visitors, whenever necessary. Commenting on preparations for receiving the body of Dr Magufuli, the RC said everything was on track, with a team from the president’s Office being in place to ensure everything went well. According to him, paying last respects will take place at Magufuli Stadium in Chato District Council. He stressed that the president’s burial ceremony was the biggest event that attracted many people and all dignitaries from various countries and there would be special arrangements which would be announced as soon as possible. Despite a big number of mourners, very few will visit Dr Magufuli’s grave, he said, adding: “The protocol will tell. We would like all mourners to be there, but for practicality’s sake we have to limit the number of those going to the grave. We are going to set up TV screens in various places to let people watch the event.” He made the call to all CCM and public leaders at all levels to cooperate to make the event a success. regional CCM Chairperson alhaj Said karidushi supported the RC, saying it was a time to show solidarity, unity, love and tolerance to avoid panic among mourners.
