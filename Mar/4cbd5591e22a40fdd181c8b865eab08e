CHAMA Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) in Chato District, Geita Region has vowed to maintain unity, love and peace as the cornerstones of promoting diplomatic and economic fabrics within the party. “That is what the late Dr John Magufuli kept on emphasizing. He also insisted on strength, confidence and courage as the qualities of a good leader,” said the Party' District Secretary, Acheny Mwinshehe, when approached by the ‘Sunday News’ to comment on how the party was set to honour the departed chairman, President John Magufuli. According to him, it was Dr Magufuli's experience that enabled CCM to secure funds through various development projects, and made all CCM leaders in the district continue working as a team. On his part, the party's District Chairperson, Mr Rafael Masambo, commended the late President for personally supervising several development projects in Chato. “He improved education and health and closely supervised them in Chato. Construction of school infrastructures and health centres were part of the projects he initiated, and hence, deserves honour. The party will also continue supporting all public leaders, including the newly sworn-in President, Samia Suluhu Hassan and we believe she has the same visions as the late Dr Magufuli,” he pointed out. Elaborating, CCM Youth Wing (UVCCM) Secretary, Mr Martine Rugambwa, said thorough supervision of all development projects in Chato was as a result of the late President personally supervising them. “He should be honoured as he was doing all these to serve especially ordinal and poor Tanzanians. As youth, we will also keep on promoting peace, solidarity and tranquility, which are the basic foundations for any development to take place,” he said.
