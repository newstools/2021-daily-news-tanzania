MORE than 239,858 villagers in 87 villages expect to access clean and safe water in 87 villages in Manyara Region. Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (Ruwasa) Regional Manager Walter Kirita said Ruwasa was constructing 617 water collecting points to ensure every resident accessed water at a reasonable distance from their homes and institutions as well as ensure sanitation was maintained. Mr Kirita said this last week when speaking with water stakeholders, adding that the residents of Simanjiro, Kiteto, Mbulu, Hanang’ and Babati would be beneficiaries of the water project. Ruwasa targets to collect and use 18bn/- in the fiscal year 2021/22 in the construction and refurbishment of water infrastructure to increase access to clean and safe water. “Other priorities are to supply clean and safe water to health centres, dispensaries, primary and secondary schools that are not connected to water supply,” explained Mr Kirita. Manyara Regional Commissioner (RC) Joseph Mkirikiti hailed Ruwasa for the way they were implementing development projects and serving people diligently. He said Manyara residents should also construct rain water harvesting infrastructure in their residential areas. “You have to be creative. Instead of complaining about shortages of water, put in place proper infrastructure for harvesting water once it starts raining. For those who have been to Newala District in Mtwara Region have seen that every house has rain water harvesting infrastructure. Let us take a leaf from Mtwara Region,” said RC Mkirikiti. Deputy Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Pauline Gekul said Babati Town residents were still not content with water prices, which she said were too high compared to other towns in the country. She said she had been complaining about that for a while, but in vain.
