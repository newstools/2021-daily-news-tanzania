ALL hospitals and health centres in Dar es Salaam Region will provide folic acid to pregnant women and all those expecting to become pregnant. The aim is to address the problem of children being born with spinal bifida and hydrocephalus, which is increasing year by year. This was said at the weekend by Dar es Salaam Regional Health Secretary Sister Mathew, when she represented the chief medical officer at a seminar of women journalists organised as part of activities to celebrate International Women’s Day held at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute (MOI) Hall in Dar es Salaam. She said the community did not have an understanding of spinal bifida and hydrocephalus diseases, so the regional authorities felt it wise to take responsibility and educate the community. “Having a baby with hydrocephalus or spinal bifida is not a bad thing and there is no reason to stigmatise them,” said Ms Mathew. She said the region would provide pills to every woman, who went to hospital or health centre to reduce the likelihood of pregnant women giving birth to babies with the diseases. She said apart from the pills, pregnant women would also be advised to eat nutritious food to mitigate the problem. “The region will provide pills and mothers should use them effectively. The pills are good for women because it helps them to give birth to healthy babies,” she said. For her part, Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Tanzania (ASBAHT) member Rahma Makame, who also has a child with hydrocephalus, said the challenge of raising such children was huge. Ms Makame urged women to go to clinic early for checkup and get folic acid tablets. “I urge my fellow women to go to hospital early because there are benefits we get from using folic acid tablets,” said Ms Makame.
