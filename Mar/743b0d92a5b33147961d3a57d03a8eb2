KILWA Masoko is known as the gateway to the south and is a perfect base for exploring the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani (aka Kilwa Ruins), one of Tanzania’s most important archaeological sites and also the Selous Game Reserve. The Kilwa Ruins are the ruins of palaces and mansions belonging to Arabic gold dealers and slave traders that ruled the east African costline from 800 – 1500. These members of the Kilwa sultanate developed a complex society including currency and Kilwa coins while Europe was still embroiled in the dark ages. A stay at Kilwa hotel can be combined perfectly with a Selous safari and we are in fact the closest beach resort to the Selous. The location on a tropical beach allows us to offer a variety of water and marine activities including hippo trips, snorkeling, fishing (both artisanal and deep-sea), diving (by end 2019). Fish caught within the last few hours are the mainstay of menu supplemented with tender squid, king-prawns, lobster and crab. Fish and seafood is sourced fresh from fishermen plying their trade at the fishing village a few hundred metres along the beach. Kilwa is becoming a resort comparable with the beach holiday destinations of Zanzibar, Mafia and Pemba Islands. The area is also a perfect combination to use with safaris in Tanzania including the the Serengetti and Ngorongoro crater.
