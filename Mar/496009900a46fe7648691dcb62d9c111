The government has expressed it's disappointment at Kenya's decision to ban importation of maize from Tanzania. The Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Hussein Bashe said this at Napanga, Tanzania-Kenya boarder, where he witnessed trucks being barred from entering Kenya, after being allegedly that maize from the country have not met the standard. "What is happening at the border is right, it can't be entertained...vehicles are being barred from entering Kenya while we have not received any official information," said Mr Bashe. However, Bashe promised traders whose maize consignments have been barred that Tanzania will intervene the matter.
