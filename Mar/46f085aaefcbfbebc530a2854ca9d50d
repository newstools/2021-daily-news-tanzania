ELDERS have requested President Samia Suluhu Hassan to upgrade Chato District in Geita to be a region. Representing Chato elders at the requiem mass for the late President Magufuli held at Magufuli grounds, Mr Samuel Bigambo said the current Tanzania’s President is the only one who has the mandate to fulfill her predecessor’s dream. “One day we had a discussion with the late President Magufuli and he told us that he wants this district (Chato) to be a region. “Will you let this wish to pass? The people of Chato have great faith and believe that you will fulfill all the wishes President Maguli had in mind for the country,” he said. He further said Chato elders believe all the projects initiated by Dr Magufuli will be implemented as he added: “However, we urge the government to continue looking and caring for the elders and ensure they are provided with all the priorities they require.”
