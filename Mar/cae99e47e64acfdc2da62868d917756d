THE media have been urged to educate the public over the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention C-190 on Violence and Harassment which is scheduled to come into force among the UN member states from June this year. Tanzania, which is among member states of the United Nations (UN), is also expected to endorse and ratify the treaty as per its internal procedures. Independent lawyer, Mr Anneny Nahum, made the appeal in Dar es Salaam during a media training organised by Actionaid Tanzania. He said the convention is aimed at strengthening systems for eradicating gender violence at workplaces. Among other things, the convention insists on strengthening the use of whistleblowers in reporting acts of gender violence at workplaces to promote gender equality. “What is costing us is the culture of silence on gender violence acts, therefore we real need whistleblowers, the good thing is that in Tanzania we have the law of whistleblowers,” Mr Nahum stated. The convention also requires member states to give more translations of the gender violence at workplaces. It concerns all workers at all sectors including those seeking jobs, on field attachments, job losers, volunteers and authorities at workplaces or employers, the lawyer elaborated. The main principles of the convention are to respect others, realise rights of other people at workplaces and promote gender equality. The process to prepare the convention started in 2015 with the aim of ending cries over gender violence at workplaces. Already four countries have ratified the convention but is not yet started to be implemented. The countries which ratified the convention include Argentina, Fiji, Namibia and Uruguay. The convention is scheduled to become into force in June this year. Member countries have to revisit their laws on labour relations and see how they match with the content of the convention, otherwise, they would be needed to amend those laws to align with this treat for domestication, he argued.
