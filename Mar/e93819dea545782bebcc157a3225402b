WEIGHT and Measures Agency (WMA) has sensitised people to use correct measurements in their businesses and reveal some dishonest businesspeople who temper with their weighing machines. WMA Public Relation Manager Irene John said on Monday that it was important for the business community to consider proper measurements to be fair to their clients. “The aim is to educate small entrepreneurs the importance of correct measurements because we need them to grow from small and medium enterprises to reach the top level,” she told reporters during Industrial Week for Women and Product Exhibition, adding: “We sensitise them on how they can package their products in international standards so that their products can shine in regional and international markets and this can be achieved if there are also correct measurements.” She noted that the government had also opened a market for mining all over the country and WMA had been in the fore front to inspect weighing machines used in businesses. She said the aim was to ensure small miners got what they deserved in their business and government collected what it deserved from that business. WMA Measurement Department Officer Glory Mtana said many small entrepreneurs had visited their pavilion and most of them were asking about how they could be competent to package their products at international standards. “We started educating entrepreneurs after we found that most of them were not competent in this area and this is an on-going programme to ensure we reach as many people as we can,” she said. She explained that many SMEs needed education on various areas so that they could compete with others and improve their businesses.
