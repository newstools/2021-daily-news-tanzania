THE Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASA) has been urged to revive dormant water projects for provision of clean and safe drinking water. The call has been made by the Chairman of the Biharamulo District Council Mr Leo Lushau during a meeting of various stakeholders to discuss development projects in the district. “We should seek all possible strategies to revive these projects despite the fact the our district’s budget is very meagre compared to other district councils,” he said. RUWASA Manager Mr Lukasi Matina said that the Biharamulo has 960 water points, with only 640 of them in operation. He said 320 water points are dormant after some sources dried up while some water wells also destroyed. “In efforts to revive the dormant projects and make the available ones sustainable, RUWASA has been encouraging the public to protect water sources. We are also set to visit all water projects,” he said.
