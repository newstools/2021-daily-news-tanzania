DAR ES SALAAM Regional Commissioner (RC) Abubakar Kunenge has advised Tanzanians to use approved herbs in fighting against diseases, saying they are safe for health. Mr Kunenge said the herbs approved by experts had been used by various people in curing diseases and that it was important to consider using them. He made a call when he paid a visit to Tanzania Industrial Research and Development (Tirdo), the producers of several herbal medicines, including Covidol used in fighting against various respiratory diseases. "We use our own herbs and a high level of expertise to make these medicines, also they go through laboratory tests before being released. So, I can confidently say that these herbal medicines are good, professionally made and they don't have any problem," he said. His statement comes few weeks after President John Magufuli called for Tanzanians to use local medicines in fight against Covid-19. Mr Kunenge commended Tirdo for its commitment to improving the industrial sector through robust research and invention of traditional medicines. "I thank you for your contribution to the development of the industrial sector in our country. Our region is a business hub, our intention is to ensure there is an enabling environment for investors to start businesses," he said. According to the founder of Covidol, Prof Hamisi Malebo, the medicine proved to be effective after going through a number of trials with positive results in combating Covid-19. Tirdo now produces over 50,000 bottles of Covidol per day. "My message to Tanzanians is that we have medicine that works, protects and cures," he said.
