DEPUTY Minister for Water, Engineer Maryprisca Mahundi has warned Primary and Secondary schools girls against indulging in sexual acts that might plunge them into early pregnancies and contracting sexual transmitted infections (STDs), including HIV/ AIDS. Equally, she challenged them to study hard in order to become future good leaders. Eng Mahundi made the advice during her recent tour in Kagera Region where, among other things, she visited Mubaba High School, in Biharamulo District and addressed the students and teachers. “Prevention of teenagers from having sexual intercourse at early stages is a very important intervention in preventing pregnancies at early ages. Education on sexuality, its impacts and uses of contraceptives’ should be provided in Primary School at early grades. “Programmes targeting attitudes and social norms that facilitate knowledge against sexual activities among the youth should be encouraged,” she added. She further said that President John Magufuli has hopes among the youth and that is why he appointed her and Minister Jumaa Aweso to head the Water ministry. “We must dedicate and work hard to prove wrong some of the ‘prophets of doom’ with negative attitude that the only place for a woman is the kitchen. Girls have the potential to perform well in life if given the chance,” she said. The Deputy Minister also urged parents to ensure they make a close follow-up on their children while in school and know their academic performance. In response, Mubaba High School Headmaster, Alfred Katobezi informed her that the school was founded in 2008 and currently has 1,074 students from Form One- Form Six including 507 girls. However, he said the school faces some challenges including water shortage and unreliable electricity supply, prompting the deputy minister to assure them that plans were underway to provide them with a permanent source of water.
