BOLT Tanzania has introduced a working time limit to curb road accidents due to driver’s fatigue. Bolt Country Manager Remmy Eseka said in Dar es Salaam on Monday that the number of hours’ restriction also allowed drivers to pursue other priorities such as family needs, recreational, educational and entrepreneurial activities. “Bolt Tanzania is committed to innovating ways of improving and enhancing our platform not only for passengers, but also for drivers who are an important part of our business,” Mr Eseka said. The country manager said prioritising the driver’s mental and physical well-being was crucial to drivers themselves and passengers for arriving safely at their destinations. “We trust this resolution will help reduce not only road accidents, but also improve interactions between drivers and passengers,” he said. Drivers confirming orders on Bolt can only stay active for a combined period of 12 hours. Once the 12 hours have been exhausted, the driver will be restricted from operating. This indicates that the driver must take a mandatory break to recharge and pursue other interests before getting back the wheel. “The 12-hour operational cap (also) applies to drivers of cars, rickshaws and motorcyclists,” he said. A recent study conducted by Arrive Alive shows that 20 per cent of road accidents are due to fatigue. Simultaneously, in Africa, the issue is believed to be even more pronounced as anecdotal evidence suggests that as many as 60 per cent of road accidents may be due to the driver’s tiredness. Drivers who are deprived of sufficient breaks are exposed to neurobehavioural effects and impair performance of all types of work - physical and mental.
