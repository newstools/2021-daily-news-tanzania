HAI Member of Parliament Saashisha Mafuwe has called upon relevant authorities in schools to introduce entrepreneurship programmes. He said it was pertinent even if it would be outside the regular curriculum, a move he said would help students become self-employed instead of relying on formal employment. Mr Mafuwe said this recently in Hai District, Kilimanjaro Region, on the occasion of congratulating sponsors and teachers of Islamic Solidarity Centre on good exam results. “By introducing entrepreneurship studies, this will help students have a second thought of becoming self-employed when they realise that there are no job opportunities available. Many schools do not include entrepreneurship in their programmes, which makes students grow up with the concept that they are just studying to get employed somewhere one day after school. This should change because the world, including employment, is changing also,” he said. Lack of entrepreneurship skills, he noted, deprive students of confidence in life issues, which limited their future prospects. “This can be proved by the fact that it is parents who come to your office to seek a job for their children and not the children themselves. This is lack of confidence. If they get extra skills, they can have confidence in making followups on their needs.
