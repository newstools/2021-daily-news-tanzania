WITH increasing cases of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in the country, adults have been advised to go for cervical and prostate cancer screening so that they could know their health status. The call was made here by Mr Haji Khamis Fundi, from the association of the people with Non-Communicable Diseases in Zanzibar who said that many people were afraid of testing. “Do not be afraid to find out about your health status, it helps to get early treatment when it is still in early stages. Never be afraid,” Mr Fundi said at a meeting with journalists aimed at increasing public awareness about the diseases. Mr Fundi emphasised on the importance of educating the community to protect themselves from non-communicable diseases. He urged the community to abandon fears and go for health check up from time to time. Mr Omar Abdalla Ali, a medical staff from the noncommunicable disease unit, said that breast cancers, cervical cancer among women, as well as prostate cancer among men were on rise in the isles. He advised females in their 30s and men in their 40s to get tested at least once a year for prostate and cervical cancer so that they could identify health complications related to the problems for early treatment.
