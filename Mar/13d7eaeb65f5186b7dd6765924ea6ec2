PARENTS and guardians across the country have been urged to identify children who experience ear, nose and throat problems and take them to specialist doctors before it is too late. A specialist advised parents and guardians to observe children who kept touching ears since it could be a sign of serious ear pain, nose and throat (ENT). A surgeon in the Otorhinolaryngology Department at Bugando Zonal Referral Hospital, Dr Olivia Michael, told the ‘Daily News’ at the weekend that parents needed to observe all signs their children showed so that they might consult specialist doctors for ENT examination. “When you ignore those signs, it means you give a chance to the middle ear's auditory tube to generate fluids that eventually burst the ear's tympanic membrane,” she said. She made the call to parents to immediately seek medical advice after observed regular ear, nose or throat touch, saying almost all health complications were curable when attended earlier. Dr Michael explained further that the ear was at risk of infection whenever the throat and nose experienced any complication, which blocked communication on the ENT system.
