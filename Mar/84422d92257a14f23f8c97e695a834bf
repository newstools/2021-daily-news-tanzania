PREVENTION and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) has recovered a total of 29,656,800/- which was stolen through inflated coffee sales, it has been disclosed. Kagera Regional PCCB Chief Mr John Joseph told reporters that during 2018/2019 season, the Tanganyika Instant Coffee Public Limited Company (TANICA PLC) bought a consignment of 123,570 kilogrammes of coffee from Ngara-based Arab Globe International Company, at an inflated rate of 3,000/- per kg instead of the market price of 2,740/- per kg. “In the process, Arab Globe International Company unlawfully pocketed 29,656,800/-,” he said as he handed the recovered money to TANICA PLC Production Manager Mr Mkombozi Sanga. On January 23, this year, Kagera Regional Commissioner Marco Gaguti dissolved the board of the TANICA- Plc, directing the Assistant Registrar of Cooperatives to supervise immediate replacement of new board members. Brig. Gen Gaguti made the directive when he visited TANICA Plc, accompanied by members of the Regional Defence and Security Committee. “I have received reports indicating that TANICA was operating below the required standards incurring big losses in the process. Also, directives given by the government were not properly followed,” he said. TANICA shareholders have a total of 18,094,568 paid up shares worth 1,447,565,440/-. They include Kagera Cooperative Union (KCU 1990) with 9,656,391 shares worth 772.5m/- and Karagwe District Cooperative Union (KDCU) with 5,758,740 shares worth 460.7m/-. Others are Treasurer Registrar with 1,388,000 shares worth 111.0m/-, Tanzania Federation of Cooperatives with 1,125,000 shares worth 90m/-and TANICA workers with 166,437 shares worth 13.3m/-. The Company changed its name from Tanganyika Instant Coffee Company to Tanganyika Instant Coffee Public Limited Company (TANICA PLC) with effect from August 19, 2015. Meanwhile, PCCB also recovered about 15m/-, which was handed to Mr Laurian Rweyemamu, (62), a retired Trade Officer in Muleba District. According to Mr Joseph, the old man after his retirement approached a Mulebabased businesswoman, identified as Ms Daicola Charles Wangumbo and took a loan in two installments amounting 7m/-. However, the loan was supposed to be returned on a 100 per cent interest rate amounting 14m/-. The unsuspecting Mr Rweyemamu eventually received his government pension on November 6, 2018 amounting 42m/-. However, he was surprised to be informed by his lender (Ms Wangumbo) that the loan had increased to 40m/- and he was ordered to surrender his ATM Card. The matter was eventually reported to the PCCB. “We are closely following up the matter to recover the remaining 25m/-,” Mr Joseph said. In a related development, the Regional PCCB Chief has appealed to business people to effectively use electronic fiscal devices (EFDs) and to ensure that they issue receipt if they want to increase their business volume. He warned that it was an offence for a person doing business with the annual turnover of 14m/- not to use EFDs and fail to issue receipt. “Such an offender could be subjected to a fine ranging between 3m/- and 4.5m/- or imprisonment of up to three years or both. Similar punishment also applies to business people who tamper with EFDs,” he said. Elaborating further, Mr Joseph said a Bukoba-based businessman, who owns Kabago shop was fined 3m/- for committing an offence of “Under Invoicing” Contrary to Section 86(1) (c) and (d) of the Financial Act. “Investigations revealed that the businessman sold a bottle of whisky at 35,000/- but instead he deceitfully issued a receipt for 3,500/-,” he said as he handed the recovered money to Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) officials.
