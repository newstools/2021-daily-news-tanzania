PRESIDENT Hussein Mwinyi has called on the people of Zanzibar to continue praying to the Almighty God “to help us maintain peace and unity as the country recovers slowly from the impact of Covid-19.” "We are proud of the prevailing peace and political stability. Let us cherish it through getting committed to work as we also continue praying so that Covid-19 diminishes to pave the way for the economic development of our country," said Dr Mwinyi. In his short message to Zanzibaris after Friday prayers held at 'Mfereji-wa-wima' Mosque on the outskirts of Stone Town, Dr Mwinyi said all Zanzibaris were one and it was important that they maintained peace and unity. He said further that since Zanzibaris were enjoying peace, love, stability and unity, there was hope for speeding up development. Earlier, Sheikh Abdulkarim Said Abdallah, who led the Friday prayers, said there was a need for Muslims to support the government by maintaining peace and unity in the country after the great work of uniting Zanzibaris. Sheikh Abdulkarim emphasised that for any country to make progress, the first thing was to ensure peace and unity so that development could be achieved, and that every resident had a role to promote peace and unity. He said under peace and stability people's expectations would be met and God would bless all that to make Zanzibaris united. He added that it was obvious that President Mwinyi had done great things, including uniting Zanzibaris and electing the First Vice-President from the opposition.
