THE Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) has said entrepreneurs in the country need to abide to laws and regulations that bind them to register business premises as fundamental way to protect the health of the people. The remarks were made by the TBS Inspector Alfred Kafaransa while speaking on the ongoing inspections of food and cosmetic premises in the Coast Region over the weekend. He said the door to door education is involving all premises dealing with the sale of food, bar, hotel and restaurants. He mentioned others namely those dealing with food and cosmetics both retail and wholesale and all the other involved in storing food like warehouses and milling machines. He added that the inspections also went alongside formalising their businesses. “After recognizing and formalising their business, we put their records in a database and this make it easier to provide support in addressing challenges that arise in business operations,” he said adding that this has helped to keep them in touch and they can easily access TBS services. The objective of the ongoing inspections is to go through all unregistered businesses in order to recognise and officially formalise them. “For all those who encountered problems with the online registration system, this has been an important opportunity to open them an email account that may be used in the registration process, “ he said. In the Coast Region, the exercise started in Mkuranga, Vikindu, Kisemvule, Kongowe and Kimanzichanya south. The TBS team them went to Kisarawe District particularly in Kiluvya A and B as well as Makurange. He said it is the Finance Bill of 2019 that gave TBS the mandate to inspect and register food and cosmetic premises formally done by the then Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA).
