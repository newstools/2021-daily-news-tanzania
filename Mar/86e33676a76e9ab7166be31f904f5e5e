PUMA Energy Tanzania has marked International Women’s Day in style by offering free fuel to some vehicles driven by female customers to its petrol stations across Dar es Salaam. In particular, the company filled the full tank to vehicles of some key women who had made great contributions to communities. They included the founder of Dorris Mollel Foundation Doris Mollel, Executive Director of NN General Group, which supplies pads for women, and popular artiste Judith Wambura (alias Lady Jaydee). It was also a happy day for rickshaw female drivers who conduct their activities in the city centre as their vehicles were refuelled fully. Puma Human Resources Manager Happiness Hoyange said Puma valued International Women’s Day and gave women leadership positions in the company. She said the company dedicated the day to reward their female customers in recognition of the role they plaid at both corporate and national level. One of the female rickshaw drivers in the city, Ms Jasmine Milanzi, who was among the customers benefited from free petrol, expressed her joy for the day, saying it encouraged them more to be recognised as among important women. “I am a rickshaw driver with a physical disability, but through this business I am capable of meeting my family needs,” she said. Puma Energy Tanzania Operations Manager Lameck Hiliyai told women to disregard the mentality that fuel business was mainly for men and encouraged them to utilise filling stations business opportunities. “As one of the companies in the fuel business it is our duty to continue improving the welfare of women within the company and in communities,” he assured.
