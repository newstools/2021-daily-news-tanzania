MULEBA North Member of Parliament, Mr Charles  Mwijage has appealed to the government to intervene in purchasing them a pontoon that would ease water transport woes in the area. He said over 200,000 residents  in three Islands of Bumbire, Kelebe and Goziba lack reliable water transport vessel(s), hence depend only on small unsafe boats. “We appeal for government intervention to buy a pontoon that will be plying between Kyamkwikwi and three Islands-Bumbire, Kelebe and Goziba. “Several women die on the way before reaching Rubya Designated Hospital (DDH) in Muleba district, a distance of over 80 kms from the Archipelago,” he added. Narrating a personal ordeal how he narrowly escaped  drowning while sailing from Bumbire Island  together with four Muleba Councillors, he said: “We were hit by strong winds and it was terrible and everyone got scared beyond description." Meanwhile, eight Councils in Kagera Region with internal sources have promised to raise  a total of  19,803,846,870/- during this 2021/2022 financial year. Presenting the estimates before the RCC meeting the Assistant Secretary (Planning and Coordination), Mr Onesphory Bwana said  the Councils   estimated to collect   a total of  24,442,050,000/- during 2020/2021 financial year. However, he noted the central government during 2020/2021 fiscal year assigned them to raise a total of 276,094,776,500/-, adding: “Until December, last year the region had already received about 103,854,573,017/-, an equivalence of 38 per cent.”
