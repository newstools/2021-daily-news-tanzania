THE Agricultural Markets Development Trust (AMDT) has underscored the importance of identifying opportunities and challenges that hinder women and youth to excel in the sector. AMDT has organized a stakeholders’ consultative workshop which will identify the challenges and available opportunities and come up with the best practices which women and youth will benefit. AMDT Executive Director Charles Ogutu said during the workshop, proposals would be incorporated in their next year’s 5-year projects to improve the welfare of women and youth engaged in the agriculture value chains. “Women and youth constitute a huge workforce, and they have to be empowered to know the setbacks and available opportunities to improve their socio-economic wellbeing,” said Mr Ogutu. The consultative workshop which includes women chambers of commerce, food processors, farmers, stakeholders, development partners seeks to to know the actual situation in the field and plan for the future. He said they want to improve their work so that the income and employment opportunities for poor women, men and young people are increased in the agricultural value chains in the country. The move, intends to bring the desired outcomes of smallholder farmers and related medium and small medium entrepreneurs to be able to compete and prosper in selected agricultural markets. Also it wants to create an enabling environment for improvement in agricultural value chains, including the rules, regulations and policy. Mr Ogutu noted that the trust wants to see farmers use all the available market opportunities in the agriculture sector and improve the business environment in areas where there is need to do so. AMDT runs the project in all zones with the exception of Eastern zone which comprises the regions of Tanga and Coast.
