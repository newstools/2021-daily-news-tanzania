NINE people including some local citizens and Sri Lanka nationals have taken advantage of opportunities offered by Chief Justice Ibrahim Juma recently to go for published new plea bargaining rules to end the 31bn/- economic, tax evasion and mineral deal cases against them.

Advocate Hudson Ndusyepo, who is defending some of the accused persons, informed the court that his clients were willing to enter into plea bargaining agreement and have already wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), expressing their desire to end the criminal trials. He invited the magistrate to invoke the provision of Rule 5 of the Criminal Procedure (Plea Bargaining) Rules, 2021 to give directions and prescribe time within which the parties could negotiate and conclude the agreement. The magistrate made an inquiry from all accused persons to satisfy the court in terms of Rule 5 (2) of the Rules, whether they decided to enter into the plea bargaining agreement with the DPP voluntarily. Having so satisfied, he ordered the prosecution and defence to conclude the negotiations by March 8, 2021.
