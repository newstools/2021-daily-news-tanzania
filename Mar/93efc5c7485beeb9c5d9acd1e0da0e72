BUSINESSPEOPLE have been urged to register their business, food and cosmetic premises so that they meet the country’s legal requirements and protect consumer health. The call was made by TBS Public Relations Officer Neema Mtemvu during women entrepreneurs’ exhibition in Dar es Salaam at the weekend. Through the exhibition TBS provided education on various issues pertaining to standards where entrepreneurs and other participants used the opportunity to ask and get clarification. The emphasis during the fair was to encourage entrepreneurs to register their business, food and cosmetic premises in compliance with the Finance Act, 2019. The Finance Act places food and cosmetic safety management to TBS from the once Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA). In this regard, the registration of food and cosmetic premises is a legal obligation that businesspeople must adhere to. According to the Act, no person shall manufacture, import, distribute, sell or expose for sale pre-packaged foodstuffs and cosmetics unless the products are registered by TBS. “The Act also restricts the manufacture for sale, supply or storing food, food products or cosmetics except in premises registered under the Act,” she noted. She said the registration of business premises gave traders an opportunity to preserve their goods safely and according to standards. She said the registration of cosmetics aimed at removing or hindering entrance and use of poisonous cosmetics in local markets. In another development, Ms Mtemvu urged entrepreneurs to acquire quality standard mark at TBS free of charge because the government bore all costs. She said entrepreneurs were required to have a letter of introduction from Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) as an important requirement before obtaining the quality mark.
