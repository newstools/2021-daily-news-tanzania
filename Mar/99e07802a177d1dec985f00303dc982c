TANZANIA Bureau of Standards (TBS) has emphasized on the need for business people to register food and cosmetic premises in order to meet required standards for the safety of consumers. TBS inspector, Venance Colman said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the law requires traders to register food and cosmetic premises because they have direct effect to end users. The standards watchdog has increased the speed of inspecting food and cosmetic premises in Dar es Salaam Region to make sure that they meet the required standards. “When food and cosmetic products are not preserved properly, they may easily be damaged and cause health problems to the consumers.” “TBS has given the mandate to inspect and register shops, stores, bars and all business premises of food and cosmetics,” he said. He said the ongoing inspection is meant to remind business people on the obligation to register food and cosmetic premises reflecting the 2019 Finance Act that shifted the obligation of the once Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) to TBS. He said after changes of the law, TBS started to carry awareness campaigns to business people countrywide on the need to register business premises to meet the required standards. “TBS is providing them knowledge on how to register their business premises through the Online Application System in the simplest and efficient way,” he noted. After sending the application to TBS, the businessman is given the control number in order to make payment and then arrangement is made for inspection of the business premises. According to him, when the applicant meets the criteria and standards set by TBS, they are given a certificate for a period of one year which is renewable. “TBS inspectors will be inspecting business premises at least twice a year to see how the standards set by the watchdog are observed and make sure they meet the required health standards,” he added.
