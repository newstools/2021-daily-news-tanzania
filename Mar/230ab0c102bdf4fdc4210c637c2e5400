A RISE in students’ pass rates has been attributed to teachers’ good residential houses and meeting their necessities at Lesoiti Village in Kiteto District, Manyara Region. Kiteto District Council constructed teachers’ houses coupled with an enabling teaching environment that has led to good national results. Accordingly, Lesoiti Secondary School emerged the first in national examinations in Kiteto District, different from what it used to be in the past when it often remained behind many other schools. Lengatei Ward Education Officer Nanyama Masanga said good housing had motivated teachers. The cost of the houses constructed near the school stood at 171m/-. Before teachers were facing many challenges that made most of them prefer transfers to other schools, while those who remained were overwhelmed by a heavy workload. “Over three years ago the situation was very bad. But after improving the teachers’ housing and the learning and teaching environment, things have changed. They now work hard and we have seen positive results. “Teachers who were posted to teach here would come, stay for a while and then look for green pastures elsewhere. Now the situation has changed. Many teachers wish to be here,” Mr Masanga said. Six teachers, who live in the new buildings, get all the social services they need, get enough time to prepare their lessons and teach well. “Last year, the school performed well, it was the first in the district in national examination results. The district council has commended us for the good results. We are still doing some improvements. For example, we have been given 100m/- for another school project,” he said
