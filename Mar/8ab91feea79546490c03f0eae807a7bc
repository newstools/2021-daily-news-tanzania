The call was made by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune at a video conference of the African Union’s Peace and Security Council (PSC), where the climate change and its impact on peace and security in Africa, as well as the recent developments in Western Sahara top the agenda. “The contributors in this fund would be the wealthiest African countries, with the assistance of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Security Council and everyone involved in climate change issue,” Tebboune said. On the issue of Western Sahara, the Algerian President expressed hopes for “practical and efficient measures” to “pave the way for a sustainable solution for this long-lasting conflict.”
