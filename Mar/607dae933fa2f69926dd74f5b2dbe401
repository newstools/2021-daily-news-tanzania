TANZANIA Women Chamber of Commerce (TWCC) is committed to seeing that at least its members establish a big factory in every region. TWCC said they would achieve their ambition by providing education and helping women and the youth to become large entrepreneurs within three years. TWCC Chairperson for Northern Region Joyce Ndosi said the chamber’s aim was to first ensure it identified targeted women and young entrepreneurs in all regions and at least within three years some regions women would own big factories. “[Already] within [the last] three years, at least, a few factories have started operations,” Ms Ndosi, who is also the TWCC chairperson for Kilimanjaro said. The northern region chairperson, who is also TWCC board member, said at the weekend when visiting the Women's Week Exhibition at TTCL Kijitonyama, Dar es Salaam, that they had received a number of orders for some products inside and outside the country, but lacked factories. “We hope to get big factories in every region. Right now we are getting a lot of orders, especially from foreign countries, but now we do not have the capacity,” she said. She appealed to women who had business ideas to contract TWCC offices for further information and networking. TWCC has more than 50,000 members countrywide and still the chamber is open for more members. TWCC has a global outreach that connects some 50 million members. Meanwhile, yesterday in Kilimanjaro Region, about 5,000 women under TWCC umbrella marched as part of International Women's Day celebration.
