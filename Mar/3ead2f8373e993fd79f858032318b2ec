TANZANIA Media Foundation (TMF) Interim Executive Director Fausta Musokwa has said journalists are supposed to observe professional ethics in exposing cases of violence against children to support the government and various stakeholders in the country. He said the journalists must use their profession to raise public awareness on violence against children. She made the call in Dar es Salaam at the weekend during media training on how to report children’s cases. Training was organised by Child Right Media Foundation and supported by Child Right Violence Prevention Fund (CRVPF). “Journalists should use their media by complying with reporting principles to influence the community to avoid acts of violence against children from family level,” she said, while also thanking stakeholders for organising capacity building training to journalists. Several topics were presented, including principles and considerations during interviews with children who had been subjected to acts of violence. Mr Ahmed Kipozi, who was among the facilitators, reminded the journalists that to get children’s stories which concerned violence acts required research to identify the root cause of the problem. CRVMF Director Janeth Mwenda said they would expand training to build the capacity of journalists in the fight against violence. CRMF has been working with various stakeholders, including journalists, to convey accurate information to children to prevent acts of violence as it is against human rights. She said some parents/ guardians had had little understanding of violence against children, which had led to an increase in cases of violence against children.
