FORMER Home Affairs Minister Lawrence Masha and two other officials haveÂ appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam facing two criminal charges relating to violation of laws establishing the Workers Compensation Fund (WCF). He is charged jointly with Malvinne Kitilya and Innocent Macha, who are co-Directors of Eco-Protection Tanzania Limited, on charges of failure to furnish returns of employees and pay statutory contributions to the Fund's Director General. It is alleged that ECO is the leading waste management business in Tanzania providing collection, treatment and recycling services. Through the expertise of her people and investment in technology, the company promotes and delivers sustainable waste management solutions. Before Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba, the three accused persons denied the charges, which are alleged to have been committed contrary to sections 73 (10 (a) and (7), as well as section 75 (1) (2) (3) (4) of the Workers Compensation Act, 2015. They were granted bail on each of them securing one surety, who signed bond of 2m/-. The case was adjourned until April 1, 2021 for preliminary hearing. Investigations into the matter, according to the prosecution led by State Attorneys Deo Victor and Slyvia Mitanto, have been completed. Before adjournment of the case, the prosecution requested the court to issue an accused summons against another director of the company, Edmund Hazal, whose charges against him were not read over because he was not present. The court granted the request in question and subpoenaed him. Prosecuting, the trial attorney told the court that on diverse dates between June 30, 2016 to to date in the City of Dar es Salaam, the accused persons failed to furnish to the Fund's Director General some returns of earnings of employees of Eco Protection Tanzania Limited.
