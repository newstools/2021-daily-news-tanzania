THE Minister for Agriculture, Professor Adolf Mkenda has launched an agricultural business farming project-Kizimba Business Model that is a brainchild of Sokoine University of Agriculture aimed at increasing farmers’ yields. It is set to employ SUA finalists as well as local youths and simultaneously act as demonstration farms for small farmers to acquire skills on how to increase and improve in their agricultural activities. The model is coordinated by the Sokoine University Graduate Entrepreneurs Cooperative (SUGECO) and in its initial stage being implemented in Nzega, Kibiti and Liwale Districts. Elaborating, the minister praised the three district councils for setting aside a piece of land to enable the finalist students and local youth to embark on expert farming. Equally, he asked councils to cooperate with SUGECO and try their strategic farming reforms, which guarantee farmers increased crop productions. Prof Mkenda further said Tanzania currently needs to stimulate investment flows and motivate farmers and investors to achieve the goals, adding: “We need deep-rooted reforms in the agricultural sector in order stimulate industrial investments as a way of increasing our farmers’ incomes.” On his part, SUGECO Managing Director Revocatus Kimario said the system seeks to bring farmers together as a team so that they get assisted, and pulled out of poverty. A SUA finalist, Mr Yohana Sewa who is also a SUGECO member said empirical evidence had shown that the system would go a long way in changing the farmer’s mindset, and encourage them to consider farming as any other job in rural Tanzania.
