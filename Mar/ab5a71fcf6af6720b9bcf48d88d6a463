THE National Assembly Deputy Speaker, Dr. Tulia Ackson, who is also Mbeya Urban Constituency Member of Parliament, has received 324 galvanized iron sheets to help in roofing six classrooms at Itende Secondary School, Mbeya region. The donation from TIB Development Bank through its Director of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs Patrick Mongella  said the area for a long time lacked a secondary school, and it was important to provide them with one. He further said the bank donated the items to motivate students to study hard, adding that was one way they could plough back to the community. “Recognizing the fact that education is one of the areas we need to support the government in, our bank contributed to support Mbeya City Council to complete the education infrastructure and accommodate students selected to join Form One,” said Mr Mongella. He further said they would continue with the spirit so that many students become motivated to enroll in big numbers and enjoy the free education the fifth phase government is offering in the country. Speaking during the event, the legislator who was also the guest of honour, said that the donation in a way supports the government under President John Magufuli to continue improving the education sector. However, she thanked the bank for the support, adding that for some time the area did not have a secondary school and that forced some children to stop pursuing advanced studies. In a related development, the Deputy Speaker appealed to other stakeholders, especially banks to come forward and help other wards in the region, which lack secondary schools citing some as  Izawa and Itagano all in Mbeya City. "I would like to take this opportunity to call upon other financial institutions to support the government's efforts in improving the education sector in the country," she said.
