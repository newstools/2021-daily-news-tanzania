MALYA Sports Development College principal Richard Mganga said their college will never forget President John Magufuli due to his immense support he provided to boost the college’s performance. Speaking to The ‘Daily News’, he said during the Magufuli presidency, their College produced a very large number of professionals in the sports industry. "President Magufuli has been instrumental in improving the infrastructure of our college, he allocated funds in 2019/2020 for drilling a water well and construction of sports ground. " Mganga said. He further said President Magufuli helped their college to get development funds so as to ensure the college produces more professionals. He said in honour of President Magufuli their college will be providing various sports training to different regions so that sports sector can do well. Mganga said during the fifth Phase reign, they managed to introduce a certificate course in sports for form four leavers so that they too could get a variety of opportunities to teach and learn sports. "We have managed to increase the training of 9 sports from six sports we had previously, we have also improved the sports curriculum and we are currently in the process of opening sports facilities in Dodoma and Ruvuma regions," said Mganga. He said they have increased the sports of global level such as lawn tennis and table tennis in their teaching curriculum. He said since 2012 their college has never received funding for development but through President Magufuli, in 2019, their college received that funding and was able to make various progresses. He said their college is currently in the process of setting up an Academy.
