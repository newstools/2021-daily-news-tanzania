A WATER project in Mwadila Ward, Maswa District has been completed at 275m/- and assuring over 9,000 villagers with clean and safe water. Lake Victoria Basin Water Board Deputy Director, Mr Renatus Shinhu who was supervising the project said it was started October last year and involved tapping over 90,000 cubic litres for the villagers. “The beneficiaries are 9016 villagers and the board is now crosschecking that they all have clean and safe water, because for a long time Maswa people have missed such services,” he said. He further said the scheme will only cater for Mwadila Ward residents and urged them to protect the water infrastructure for the coming generations also to benefit. A survey by the ‘Daily News’ established that about  20637 livestock keepers in the district will also benefit from the project. Mr Shinhu said: “The livestock have been facing real challenges especially during  drought, but our new intervention will provide them with water throughout the year. “But with this being over, the board is now focusing on Magu and Kwimba Districts in Mwanza region, Bunda in Mara and Chato in Geita and invite also fellow Tanzanians to attend this coming Water Week for public awareness.”
