THE Director of Public Prosecution, Biswalo Mganga, has warned people engaging in gambling and pyramid business schemes that they are illegal, and risk persecution. Speaking in Dodoma, Mr Mganga said whoever is engaging in the business should remember the incident, where the government acted tough and seized 42.5bn/- proceeds from the illegal deal. Just a few years ago, the government forfeited assets of Development Entrepreneurship for community initiative (DECI) including 16bn/- after swindling Tanzanians that it was a religious organisation. Equally, the DPP reminded the general public to report conmen to the authorities, adding: “Currently, there are new approaches they use via social media, as religious leaders, politicians and members of the media fraternity, aimed at convincing their targets to join them.” Citing a case study, Mr Mganga named QNET Limited as a company registered in Hong Kong specifically to deal with selling several projects online via www.qnet.net, but wooing the public to join them in training. “On February 1st this year, QNET wrote a letter to the Minister for Trade and Industry and copied me, requesting that the government should provide them with security, however, I did not act because I was not mandated, hence directed investigation officers to intervene and take appropriate measures,” he pointed out.
