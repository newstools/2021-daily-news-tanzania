The Red Devils have announced they have made internal promotions for the two new roles which have been created at the club. Reports say Manchester United have confirmed the appointment of a football director and technical director that will change how the club negotiate transfers. The positions have been widely discussed and rumoured for a while, with a list of big names in the game being linked with the positions, although the club have confirmed they have promoted from within. John Murtough, who has been with United for seven years and is currently head of football development, the appointee will be the new football director while former United midfielder Darren Fletcher will be technical director.
