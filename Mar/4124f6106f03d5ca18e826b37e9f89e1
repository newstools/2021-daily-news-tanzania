TWENTY-YEAR old Anadhati Mchongea appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday, charged with two counts of trafficking in 239.25 grammes of heroin and 112.09 grammes of bhang, which are narcotic drugs. She was arraigned jointly with another person, Emanuel Msakuzi, alias Makuzi (23) with the two economic counts before Senior Resident Magistrate Rashid Chaungu. The duo was not allowed to enter plea to the charges because the case has been filed under the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act. Under such circumstances, the magistrate informed the accused persons that his court lacked jurisdiction to entertain anything, including the question of bail. He ordered them to remain in remand until March 22, 2021, when the case will be mentioned, as investigations are incomplete. Prosecuting, State Attorney Kijja Ruzingana told the court that on January 22, 2021 at Kauzeni in Kunduchi Beach area in Kinondoni District, in the city, jointly and together, the two accused persons were found trafficking heroin weighing 239.25 grammes.

He ordered the accused to stay in remand until March 22, 2021, when the case will be mentioned. Investigations, according to the prosecution, have not been completed.
