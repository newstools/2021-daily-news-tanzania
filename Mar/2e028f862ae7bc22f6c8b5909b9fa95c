DAR ES SALAAM-based Chausiku Foundation has come up with a special campaign to help secondary schoolgirls with free sanitary towels as a step to make them comfortable in their studies. According to Chausiku Foundation Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Officer Elizabeth Shagi, the exercise will first benefit about 400 girl students from Salma Kikwete Secondary School and Kiparang’ada Secondary School. “As you know, girl students experience a lot of challenges in their studies and one of them is lack of sanitary towels, which are very important to them. We have come up with this initiative to help them. We alone cannot realise this mission. That is why we ask members of the public and stakeholders to support us in any way they can so that we may reach as many girl students as possible,” she said. She added that in the first phase, they had opted to begin with two secondary schools only and that later they would reach more schools across the country. Ms Shagi noted that their priority was to help over 5,000 girl students throughout the country to access sanitary towels, while insisting that their performance in class could double if they studied comfortably. “Skipping classes and sometimes dropping out of school is the most common effects of lack of these sanitary towels because they feel insecure to learn well during their menstrual period. To help them we need the support of every person. “For us, we have an idea to bring about changes to girls, but an idea alone cannot transform anything as such. Cooperation is needed to meet the goals,” she said.
