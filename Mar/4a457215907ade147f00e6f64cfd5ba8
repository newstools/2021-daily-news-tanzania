DODOMA City Council has set aside 1bn/- for road construction and improving access to clean and safe water. This was said by Dodoma City Council Director Joseph Mafuru after winding up the council’s meeting that received, discussed and approved the 2021/22 budget. He said the move to set aside the funds was part of the city’s strategy to continue developing and improving its infrastructure. “We are aware that there are authorities that are responsible for water and roads, but we decided to set aside funds from our own sources to improve services to our people especially to newly established settlements,” he explained. He said for the 2021/22 fiscal year, the city council had planned to spend 120.8bn/- at least 83 per cent would be directed to development projects. Revealing about the implementation of the half of the 2020/21 fiscal year, he said 14.76bn/- was collected and disbursed to several strategic projects that included the improvement of social services and compensation. He also said Dodoma City Council had issued 15,512 business licences, while spending about 11.5bn/- on the construction of a strategic hotel - Dodoma City Hotel - and the construction of the government city complex. “The project to set up the hotel in the city centre had reached 90 per cent and was expected to be launched in April this year, while the government city complex project had reached 60 per cent,” he said. He said the completion and implementation of the projects would enable the city to increase its revenue, where the hotel expected to generate 1bn/- a year and the government city complex was expected to generate about 800m/- annually. He added that during the beginning of the second half of 2020/21, at least 59,139 plots had been surveyed.
