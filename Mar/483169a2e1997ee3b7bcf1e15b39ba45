WINTECH Tanzania Limited has started manufacturing toner for laser printers locally, a move that saves business up to 60 per cent of their costs. The firm, which has the capacity to produce various powders for lesser, currently has a production capacity of 15,000 toner cartridges in three months. Wintech CEO Eng Emmanuel Nkalang’ano claimed that their toner has met international standards and is as good as imported ones. “Our cartridge, named ‘DN Toner Cartridge GVT’ class, is cheaper and meets international standards,” Eng. Nkalang’ano said. The DN Toner Cartridge class are not only sold locally but also exported to various neighbouring countries such as Burundi, Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique. “We export more to DR Congo,” he said, adding “we are still looking for local market to maximise output.” The other advantages of using DN Toner cartridge is on it environmental friendliness. “The toner is made using recycling technology which has minimal environmental consequences when it comes to degradation,” Nkalang’ano said. According to him, the newly-discovered toner cartridge uses technology named as government tonner class, which is applicable in all types of lesser printers and it prints more 500 extra papers compared to other types of cartridges in the market due to its recycling capability. “The plant is in Temeke municipality and has enough capacity to meet the needed demand. This will support us to create more jobs for Tanzanian youths,” he explained. The company, started in 2017, has so far employed 10 people but as demand increase will employ more staff
