Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan has urged Tanzanians to join forces and create emerging women leaders, starting from the girl child. She made the call on Monday in Dar es Salaam when addressing women at the climax of the International Women’s Day. She called for the formation of clubs for building the image of the girl child into leadership, while urging women in leadership to support children. She cautioned that in training and building the girl child into leadership customs and traditions of the country should not be broken. “We who are lucky enough let’s go and take care of the little children but without spoiling the traditions customs of Tanzania,” she said.
