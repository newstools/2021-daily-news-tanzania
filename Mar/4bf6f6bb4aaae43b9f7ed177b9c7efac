DR John Magufuli made great things efficiently and quickly as if he projected something strange would happen at any time. That was said in Dar es Salaam on Saturday by St Peter’s Parish Priest, Fr Alister Makubi, while celebrating requiem mass for the departed leader. In his sermon, he said Dr Magufuli was an active churchgoer at the parish church during his lifetime, adding: “Dr Magufuli tried to do things well and quickly as if he knew this (his death) would happen to him so quickly. He did great things in a very short time and put God first. We should be prepared and everyone should strive for great things to leave as a legacy… Dr Magufuli quickly without waiting for tomorrow made history, this is because no one knows of tomorrow. Life has no formula, so every human being must be prepared to help others in need because that is the ultimate meaning of life.” He, however, urged Tanzanians to always excise love and appreciate the good deeds of Dr Magufuli as everyone examines his/her relationship with God and with each other. “He would come to mass and attend funeral services of others ... today (yesterday) we have come for him. Do not be afraid because the Almighty God is taking what is His. It is important to prepare ourselves to live with love in our lives. Ask yourself how you love your fellows/neighbours and God.” He noted that Tanzanians were in a trying moment to have lost their beloved President who loved his people and nation. “We mourn because we wished he would continue living and helping us, but God has decided to take him in his due time. Despite mourning we should not cry too much and forget the work of God that is always flawless.” Referring to the Gospel of Luke 12:35-40, he said death or suffering was not the end because there was life after death. On the way to Uhuru Stadium in the city, people lined up along the streets, mourning and wailing with some throwing flowers and their clothes to the hearse carrying his body
