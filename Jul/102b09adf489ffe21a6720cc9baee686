MARA Regional Commissioner, Ally Hapi has raised a “yellow flag” to Serengeti District Executive Director, Juma Hamsini over what he described as the leader's excruciating bureaucracy to investors. Hamsini is yet to give any comment, but the region’s new boss faults the Serengeti DED for his acts that have painfully damaged the region economically. Speaking shortly after exchanging documents to hand over office from his predecessor, Mwanza Regional Commissioner, Engineer Robert Gabriel, Hapi alleged that Hamsini’s bureaucracy was slowing development in the region. “He (Hamsini) has blocked the construction of the Burunga airport in the district. Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) had already donated 1.2bn/- nonetheless, traders also volunteered to pay for fuel to vehicles used in the construction project,” he said. "I will start with the Director (Juma Hamsini) to end the bureaucracy perpetrated by some leaders against investors and thus delay development in the Region." The airport project was initiated by former President Jakaya Kikwete. Despite being launched, there is no progress registered and the director wants the money promised by Tanapa to be banked on the Council's accounts for no reason. He vowed to fight corruption in the region unmerciful.
