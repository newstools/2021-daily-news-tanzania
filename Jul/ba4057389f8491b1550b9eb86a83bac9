The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has deployed a special fact-finding mission to Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) following reports of unrest in the Southern African state. A statement issued Tuesday by the Chairperson of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defense and Security Dr Mokgweetsi Masisi said the aim of the dispatch of the mission was to seek a lasting solution in Eswatini. “The purpose of the mission was to gather first-hand information on the disturbance including the state of security in the country and to appeal for calm and restraint from all stakeholders,” said Dr Masisi. Elaborating further, Dr Masisi said that the mission intends to invest efforts in finding a lasting solution by holding open national dialogues. Recently, the Southern African small mountain kingdom was rocked by pro-democracy demonstrations and videos of people burning tires and barricading streets. Government estimates the damages to be about 3-billion Emalangini, which is an equivalent of R3 billion.
