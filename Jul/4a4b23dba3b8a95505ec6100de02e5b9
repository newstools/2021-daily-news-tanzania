Violent rioting has erupted in two South African provinces following the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma, with supporters blocking roads and looting shops. Unrest began last week after Zuma handed himself in to begin a 15-month sentence. Several people have been killed and dozens arrested. Zuma was convicted of contempt of court after failing to attend an inquiry into corruption during his presidency. The 79-year-old, who denies corruption, is hoping to get his sentence rescinded or reduced at the Constitutional Court hearing. However, legal experts say his chances of success are slim. The case has sparked an unprecedented legal drama in South Africa, which has never seen a former president jailed before. Footage on Monday showed a fire at a shopping centre in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, and people rushing in to loot. A supermarket was also ransacked, according to reports. Similar scenes were seen over the weekend, with violence spreading to the city of Johannesburg. On Sunday, protesters armed with sticks, golf clubs and branches were seen marching through Johannesburg's central business district. A South African government intelligence body said six people had been killed and more than 200 arrested since the unrest began. Police in KwaZulu-Natal have accused looters of seeking to exploit the unrest. President Cyril Ramaphosa has appealed for calm, saying that while people "may be hurt and angry" there is no justification for the violence. Zuma was convicted of defying an instruction to give evidence at an inquiry into corruption during his nine years in power. He has testified only once at the inquiry into what has become known as "state capture" - meaning the siphoning-off of state assets.
