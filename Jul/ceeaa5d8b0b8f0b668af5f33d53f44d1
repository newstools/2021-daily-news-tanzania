IT was a perfect weekend outing for Anglican Church of Tanzania Mother’s Union who swapped their warm beds for the tents in the Serengeti National Park. The 205 women, who were headed for a mission in Mara region, spent the night at Africa’s best park to marvel at nature’s beauty. Rahel Ngalya couldn’t hide her excitement over the adventurous journey, describing it as a perfect learning experience. “We had planned for this for so long and I’m happy to be here today...seeing wild animals like lions, buffaloes and wildebeests was unthinkable for me,” she said. Sleeping under the tents was a surreal experience for Ngalya and her colleagues, with lions’ roars and laughs of hyenas being heard miles away. Chemi Che-Mponda travelled all the way from Boston, Massachusetts in the United States to be part of the adventurous mission. “I’ve never been to a national park before and therefore I didn’t have any idea of how well-endowed Tanzania is,” she explained. According to Ms Chemponda, she was thrilled to be part of the mission of appreciating the beauty of nature.”What a trip, what a treat,” she added. On her part, Jenipher Abel Mdinka, a co-director of Land Africa, a tour operating company that facilitated the trip said the mission presented the women with an opportunity of marveling at God’s creation. “These women will definitely make their families proud, we look forward to have a group of men in the future,” she said. Earlier on, Senior Assistant Conservation Commissioner attached to the Serengeti National Park (SENAPA), Massana Mwishawa commended the women affiliated to the Anglican Church of Tanzania for choosing Serengeti National Park as their weekend gateway. “Away from the comfort of the bedrooms, these women have made the most of the park and I hope will be our good ambassadors,” he said. According to Mwishawa, SENAPA will continue promoting domestic tourism by hosting other big groups to the park.
