Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa on Sunday issued a seven–day ultimatum to the probe team he appointed to investigate the source of a fire outbreak at  Dar es Salaam’s popular Kariakoo market. Addressing businessmen and residents of the Kariakoo area, the premier urged the victims to exercise patients as authorities pursue the root cause of the destructive fire outbreak. “I want the team to come up with a report on what caused the fire outbreak or who caused it,” said the Prime Minister. The team he appointed comprises officers from the Office of the President State House, The Office of the President (Regional Administration and Local Governments), the Prime Minister's Office, Security Forces, Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Tanzania Building Agency (TBA), Tanzania National Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) and the Fire and Rescue Unit. Majaliwa says legal action should be imposed against those who will be implicated for their directly or indirectly involved in the incident. He quickly promised the government will discuss with financial institutions to extend loan repayment to traders who have been directly affected. Fire at the Kariakoo International Market erupted at around 8:40 p.m on Saturday destroying almost the entire main market,shops and the mini market near the famously known Shimoni Market were not seriously affected.
