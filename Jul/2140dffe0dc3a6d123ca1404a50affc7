DAR ES SALAAM Stock Exchange (DSE) domestic market capitalisation has increased by 4.0 per cent in this year quarter two thanks to increase of price of four counters. The market capitalisation for 22 domestic listed companies rose by 370.82bn/- to 9.62tri/- from 9.24tri/- in quarter one of this year. This increase, according to DSE Chief Executive Officer Quarterly Note, was led by Twiga Cement share price that went up 44 per cent to 3,600/-followed by CRDB Bank up by 28 per cent to 295/- then NICOL up by 22 per cent to 225/- and lastly DSE up by 18 per cent to 1,300/- . The bourse CEO, Mr Moremi Marwa, said in the Note that the four counters price increase was enough to offset the decrease in the other two counters. “The significant increase in prices of the counters added more to the total domestic market capitalisation proportionately to the decrease in prices on these two counters – hence the notable increase in domestic market capitalisation during the quarter,” Mr Marwa said. In the second quarter two counters saw decreases in prices namely Jatu that plunged by 29 per cent to 1,200/- and DCB Bank down 9 per cent to 240/-.

On valuation, the weighted average market Price Earnings (PE) Ratio for domestic listed companies was trailing at 22.97 times in Q2, which was slightly lower than PER of 23.45 times as of the Q1. “This decrease was attributed to the increase in prices relative to the reported earnings during the quarter,” Mr Marwa said.
