KAPUNGA Rice Project Limited has provided national health insurance (NHIF) cards to 25 children of Mkate wa Watoto Yatima orphanage at Iwambi, Mbeya region. The rice farm, largest in the country and part of Export Trading Group (ETG), offered the cards to the orphanage as part of its Easter celebrations while staff donated food stuff. The Company Public Relation Officer, Mr James Mariki, said the insurance cards and food items presented to the orphanage totalled 3.0m/-. “We have visited the centre just to show our love and sympathy to these minors [since] we are much concerned with their wellbeing,” Mr Mariki said during the handover ceremony recently. He said the company support is continuous and “the cards will be timely renewed to make sure the kids are health insured 24/7.” The Kapunga Rice Project is one of the country’s premier rice farms in Mbarali District, Mbeya. The farm is on its way to becoming the highest yielding rice farm in the country. The Orphanage Guardian, Ms Sabina Siwale, said the health insurance cards came in the time of the need and made the Easter celebrations meaningful this year. “You really predicted our needs. However, we call on more stakeholders to support us as we are still in various needs,” Ms Siwale said. The Kapunga farm has been also participating in various social activities in Mbarali, including supporting the construction of a health centre by contributing 750m/-. The centre has the capacity to attend over 18000 patients. The company also sponsored construction of 550m/- Kapunga ‘B’ Primary School with ability to accommodate over 300 pupils plus donated 20m/- for rehabilitation of the major water project in Kapunga village.
