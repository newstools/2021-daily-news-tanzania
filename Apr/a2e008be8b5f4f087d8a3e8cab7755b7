TANZANIAN envoys in the CAF Confederation Cup, Namungo seemed to have thrown in the towel as they suffered a painful 3-0 loss to Raja Casablanca at Benjamin Mkapa stadium in Dar es Salaam yesterday. It was their fifth consecutive loss in their campaign. Namungo, who narrowly lost 1-0 to Raja Casablanca in the event’s opener in Morocco, were three goals down even before the end of the first half. Raja Casablanca took about 8 minutes to open their goal account through Ilias Hadad. Namungo tried to fight for an equaliser but no serious efforts were done to enable them to score. Namungo were again punished in the 14th minute through Fabrice Ngoma. Zakaria Habti sealed the team’s goal account in the 36th minute when he netted his team’s third goal. Yesterday’s loss leaves Namungo point-less and goal-less after playing five games. They have conceded 8 total goals in their five-game outings. T hey lost 1-0 to Raja, then 2-0 to Pyramids before later losing 1-0 twice to Nkana in their both home and away matches. Still despite a dismal performance in the group stage Namungo played well during the qualifying and play-off stages. They beat Atbara of Sudan and later El Obeid of Sudan and went to the playoff against Angola’s CD Agosto.
