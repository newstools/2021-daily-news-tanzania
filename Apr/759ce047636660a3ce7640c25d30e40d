TANZANIA Bureau of Standards (TBS) has urged importers to adhere to rules and regulations on standards to avoid bringing low quality goods into the local market. The TBS Acting Head of Western Zone, Mr Rodney Alananga, made the call in Kigoma after conducting impromptu inspections in collaboration with Kigoma regional authorities to distributors and sellers of lubricants, spare parts, construction materials, food and cosmetics. “Adhering to rules and regulations on imports would not only help selling quality goods in the market but also avoid incurring losses that may arise from destroying substandard goods imported into the country,” he noted. The inspections were conducted in six districts of Kigoma Region namely Kakonko, Kibondo, Buhigwe, Kasulu, Uvinza and Kigoma. The inspections went hand in hand with provision of education to sellers and buyers on the conservation of goods as well as reading all information before using them. Also, the inspections went alongside the registration of food and cosmetic premises if they meet the required standards for conducting the business. On his part, food safety officer from TBS Elisha Meshack said the inspection exercise was on-going and would continue to other districts from the western zone including Mpanda, Tanganyika, Mpimbwe, Sumbawanga, Kalambo and Nkasi. “ This is part of our daily obligations of ensuring that inspections are conducted in all districts in the country in order to temove all low quality goods from the market,” he said. The TBS Quality Control Officer, Emmanuel Mushi urged business people whose food and cosmetic premises had already been inspected to pay the charges immediately so that they would be granted permits to operate legally. The Malagarasi Mineral General Supply Manager Samir Adam commended TBS for bringing their services closer to the people as well as offering good services by their staff.
