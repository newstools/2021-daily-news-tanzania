Brazil has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant fuels a surge in cases, according to BBC News. It has been reported that health facilities are overcrowded, with people dying as they wait for treatment in some cities, and the health system is on the brink of collapse in many areas. The country's total death toll stands at 337,000, second only to the US. Despite the surge in Covid cases, President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose any lockdown measures to curb the outbreak. He has been quoted arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, and has tried to revert some of the restrictions imposed by local authorities in the courts.
