ZANZIBAR government has called upon traders, especially small-scale businesspersons to shift and use the newly built market in Njuguni village in Pemba for their business instead of continuing to sell their commodities on roadsides. Zanzibar Second Vice- President Mr Hemed Suleiman Abdulla said that the government spent a lot of money to ensure traders in Isles get a decent place and a modern fish market to carry out their activities but have resorted to avoid using it. He said the traders were putting their lives at risk as they operate on the roadsides and filthy environment where they display their commodities, including fish for sale. He told them to relocate to the better and well organised environment. Second Vice-President gave the advice to the petty traders during his working tour in Pemba where he said it is inappropriate for the fish traders to shun the market they requested to be built. There have been no clear reasons as to why they are not using the market but it is rumored that traders shun the market for to retain customers. According to unverified reports, relocating to the newly built market will disrupt their business, something which is not true since customers will follow them to the new area. Mr Abdalla said the construction of the fish market was in response to their request, and that it is unacceptable for the traders to continue using unauthorised areas such as roadsides to sell fish. In response to other challenges facing people in the area, Mr Abdalla directed Micheweni District administration through its district council to allocate another plot suitable for the construction a new big multipurpose market. He promised further to address challenges facing the people in Njuguni village, including shortage of safe water, unreliable power supply, health facilities and poor infrastructures.
