At least 40Â people have died and up to 200 remain trapped after a train carrying nearly 500 people crashed and then derailed in a tunnel in Taiwan, sources reports. Dozens more have been injured, with rescuers trying to access several badly damaged carriages. It is reported that the train hit a vehicle that had slipped onto the tracks at the tunnel's mouth. According to sources, the Friday's crash could be the island's worst rail disaster in decades. The last major train derailment in Taiwan was in 2018, which left 18 people dead. The island's worst crash in recent history was in 1991, when 30 passengers were killed and 112 injured after two trains collided.
