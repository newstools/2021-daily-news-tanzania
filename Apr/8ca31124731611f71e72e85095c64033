The ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)’s Extraordinary Congress members have unanimously endorsed Samia Sululu Hassan as the new party’s national chairperson. Samia, who doubles as President of Tanzania, becomes the sixth party’s chairperson and the first woman to hold the CCM’s highest post since its formation. She is filling the vacuum left by Dr John Magufuli who passed away in Dar es Salaam, March 17, this year after succumbing to heart complications. Announcing the results at Jakaya Kikwete Convention Centre in Dodoma Friday afternoon, Job Ndugai, who doubles as Speaker of Tanzania’s Parliament, said Samia Suluhu Hassan garnered all 1,862 votes casted by the members of the party's national extraordinary congress. Shortly after the Ndugai’s announcement, CCM’s Women Wing (UWT) Chairperson, Gaudensia Kabaka handed Samia an award for becoming the first woman to clinch to the party’s top post. She said Samia was a symbol of eradication of the patriarchal system in Tanzania’s politics as she promised UWT’s support to the newly endorsed ruling party chairperson. On her part, the CCM’s sixth national chairperson Samia thanked members of congress for endorsing her and urged officials to get rid of creating conflicts between the citizens and their government to become a bridge for the two sides.
