THE Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam has directed the prosecution and defence to observe the new plea bargaining rules published by the Chief Justice, Prof Ibrahim Juma, for better carrying out negotiations in resolving different criminal trials. Senior Resident Magistrate in Charge Godfrey Isaya gave such directives on Tuesday when considering applications for extension of time to conclude negotiations initiated to amicably settle two trials involving 32.6bn/- payments. The first case involves 1.6bn/- trial of senior officials with BEVICO Limited, a company engaged in the business of importing and selling alcoholic beverages from abroad, while the second one is for 31bn/- economic and tax evasion case against five accused persons. In both cases, the defence applied Rule 3 of the Criminal Procedure (Plea Bargaining) Rules, 2021 and informed the court over some accused persons expressing intention to enter into plea bargaining agreement with the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to end the trials summarily. Having been satisfied that the accused persons wished to enter into the agreements voluntarily, the court invoked Rule 5 of the Rules to set 30 days as the prescribed time within which the parties are to conclude the intended negotiations. The magistrate also directed the prosecution to comply with Rule 6 of the Rules to disclose to accused persons all relevant information, documents or other matters obtained during investigation for them to make an informed decision regarding the agreement. However, when the two cases came for mention on Tuesday, defense counsel for both parties applied for extension of time as no agreement has not been reached yet, though the negotiations were progressing well. The magistrate informed the parties that the available plea bargaining rules does not provide any provision entertaining any application for extension of time. However, for ends of justice, he cautiously gave the parties in both cases another 14 days to conclude the negotiations. Both cases were adjourned to April 19, 2021 for mention pending the finalization of the negotiations in question. In the 1.6bn/- case, the accused are two French nationals, Thierry Lefeuvre and Melanie Phillippe, who are Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Manager with BEVICO Limited and two Tanzanians, Joseph Rwegasira and Ntemi Massanja, who are Finance Manager and lawyer with the company. They are facing a total of 46 counts of leading organized crime, failure to pay tax, tax evasion, forgery of various documents, uttering false documents, money laundering and occasioning loss to a specified authority.
