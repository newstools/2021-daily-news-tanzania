KILIMANJARO Regional Commissioner Anna Mghwira has asked her area Regional Immigration Officers to adhere to professional code of ethics. Speaking at the weekend while presiding over a budgetary session for the Immigration Department Workers Council, Dr Mghwira urged the officers to avoid corrupt practices and exhibit professionalism while discharging their duties. “I urge you to keep up the good work you’ve demonstrated to us over the years, but above all; shun corruption,” said the RC. On the workers Council meeting, Dr Mghwira underscored the importance of the annual gathering in resolving challenges and fostering relationships at the workplace. “Always strive to use such forums to diffuse any sort of conflicts, tensions and unnecessary conflicts at the workplace,” she pointed out. On her part, the Commissioner General of Immigration (CGI) Dr Anna Makakala, said that the workers council was an important link between them and other nationals. “This council means a lot to us as it helps to discuss the department’s achievements as far as the goals set, and at the same time help to compensate for any shortcomings,” she added.. Earlier, the Commissioner for Administration and Finance with the department of immigration, Mr Edward Chogero, said the workers council session focuses on finding lasting solutions to challenges facing the immigration department, citing some as lack of essential resources as well as remunerations for the employees.
