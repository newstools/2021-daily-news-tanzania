CHANDIMO pupils in Kondoa District were all smiles after being relieved of walking for more than ten-kilometres to attend schools after the Tanzania Social Action Trust Fund (TASAF) constructed 81.6m/- school. TASAF Coordinator in Kondoa Town Council, Mr Abdul Omar said the construction project idea came from the villagers after seeing the troubles and dangers the children were exposed to when walking for long hours to attend classes. “They submitted their proposal to us, and after seeing the need for school construction, we decided to support the villagers to undertake the project. “Initially, most of the pupils were forced to cut short their studies due to the long distance to and from the school,” he said. He said the school has three classrooms, teachers’ staff room, electricity, water infrastructure and storage facilities and latrines. Mr Omar said of the 81.6m/- a total of 73.9m/- was contributed by TASAF, 5.2m/- came from community contributions and workforce and the other 2.5m/- from the town council. Moreover, he said, through the Education Programme For Results (EP4R), other classes and teachers’ houses are being constructed to serve the community, whose most of its residents are pastoralists. Earlier, Chandimo Headteacher, Mr Gasper Chifuka said the school has a total of 407 pupils of which 215 are girls. He said the school is serving the majority of children, who are beneficiaries of TASAF projects, which support the poor and vulnerable groups. Mr Chifuka commended TASAF for the support, saying it has improved the performance of the pupils. TASAF among others intends to increase income, improve the ability to cope with shocks and enhance and protect the human capital.
