FORMER Prime Minister Mr Mizengo Pinda has appealed to Tanzanians to continue praying for God’s grace which have enabled the country to sail through peacefully after the sudden death of the late President John Magufuli. Mr Pinda made the call when addressing Roman Catholic believers of Mpanda Diocese, at Maria Immaculate Parish. The Holly Mass was presided by Rev Fr Filbert Baligwa, and Mr Pinda said the country went through a difficult time because it was the first time in history that the sitting president died. He further encouraged Tanzanians to pray for President Samia Suluhu Hassan for her new role. “We Tanzanians despite our different affiliations, we should pray for our country as well Mama Samia, who has assured us that her sixth phase administration will continue the war on corruption and laxity in delivering public services,” he said. The former premier also appealed to Tanzanians to maintain peace and tranquility for the betterment of the entire nation. President Samia was sworn on March 19 as the sixth president of Tanzania following the sudden death of her predecessor Dr Magufuli. As per Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, Ms Samia will serve as president for the remaining five-year term that ends in 2025. On his part Rev Fr Baligwa said clerics are optimistic that President Samia will move on the right path during her term in office. Equally, a cross section of citizens in Mpanda municipality interviewed separately lauded President Samia for showing her stance on corruption and her dislike for misuse of public funds.
