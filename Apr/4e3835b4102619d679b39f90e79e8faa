PLANS are afoot for the construction of 45 modern bus stands countrywide, through a robust plan for strategic projects dubbed Tanzania Cities Transforming Infrastructures and Competitiveness – TACTIC. The project is under the Ministry of State in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government. Deputy Minister in the ministry, Dr Festo Dugange told the National Assembly on Wednesday that the government was in negotiations with the World Bank (WB) to look for funding of the projects. He was responding to a supplementary question from Vwawa Member of Parliament, Japhet Hasunga, who demanded to know when the government will kick off the construction of Songwe bus stand. “I understand that all the drawings have been completed but construction of the much anticipated stand is yet to be completed, now, when will this project take off?’’ he asked. In his response, the deputy minister said that immediately after funding was sourced, the projects would kick off immediately. In his main question, Arusha Urban legislator, Mrisho Gambo had equally wanted to know when the construction of a modern Arusha bus stand would kick off. Responding, Dr Dugange said the government was currently on procurement procedures as well as looking for a consultant who will carry out a feasibility study for the project. “Arusha bus stand is part of Tanzania Cities Transforming Infrastructures and Competitiveness (TACTIC) project scheduled to be implemented in 45 cities, municipal and town councils,’’ he noted.
