THE government has expressed commitment to continue reviewing policies, laws and regulations that govern livestock sector with the aim of creating conducive investment environment and accelerating growth. Deputy Minister for Livestock and Fisheries, Abdallah Ulega, said in Parliament that the government’s zeal was to ensure that the sector benefits all people, including small-scale fishermen. He was responding to a question by Neema Lugangira (Special Seats-CCM). The MP said the current laws and fisheries policies do not meet the needs of small-scale fishermen. The deputy minister explained that the government has been reviewing policies, laws and regulations to ensure proper growth of the sector. “For example, the ministry reviewed the National Fisheries Policy and its strategies of 1997 and formulated the National Fisheries Policy of 2015 which took into account the needs of stakeholders in the sector and the sustainability of fishery resources,” he said. Mr Ulega acknowledged the need for the government to bring revolution in the sector, insisting that supportive policies and laws are paramount in reaching the objective. The deputy minister also said that the government also reviewed the Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute Act no. 6 of 1980 and enacted Act No. 11 of 2016 to enhance research activities in the country. “Also, in 2020 the Ministry made slight amendments (Miscellaneous amendments) to the Fisheries Act No. 22 of 2003 to strengthen the protection and participatory management of fisheries resources in the country. He added: “The ministry continues to make significant improvements which include addressing various concerns raised by stakeholders, especially small-scale fishermen and aquaculture.” He also said that the government will continue strengthening patrols to control random importation of livestock products while working to ensure fairness in business and protecting consumers.
