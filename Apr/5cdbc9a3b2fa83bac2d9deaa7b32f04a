TANZANIA Building Agency (TBA) has closed some of its commercial and residential buildings in Tanga region after tenants failed to pay rent amounting to about 200m/-. The eviction exercise began last Tuesday as part of continuous campaign to evict tenants with long- standing debts. The same exercise kicked off in Morogoro region on the same day. Marketing and Public Relations Manager Mr Fredrick Kalinga told reporters that in Morogoro TBA is owed 29m/-. “We are continuing with this exercise of evicting tenants who have failed or refused to pay rent as agreed in contract,” he said. According to Mr Kalinga, the same measures have already taken place in Lindi, Mtwara, Dar es Salaam and Coast region. Last year TBA Chief Executive Officer Daud Kondoro called upon all TBA tenants to pay their debts before the end of 2020. He said there would be no one to be spared during the operation to evict and close buildings for tenants who had failed or refused to pay rent. He disclosed that the total debt was 7.3bn/- from 423 tenants in all regions, and that all of them had been served with a notice, including 69 tenants from Dar es Salaam. According to Mr Kalinga, the notice expired on December 31, 2020.
