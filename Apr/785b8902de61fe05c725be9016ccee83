KENYA Commercial Bank (KCB) has come up with a programme that would instill efficiency in Tanzanian youth self-employment. That is included in the newly-introduced fund dubbed ‘Tujiajiri Youth Programme’ that will be offering a special training on that front. KCB targets more trade efficiency education ahead of extending credit facilities to the youth, lest it be wastage of time and resources. KCB Head of Legal Services & Company Secretary, Ms Antonia Kilama, announced the good news towards the end of the week. She was speaking at a function to congratulate the newly appointed East African Community (EAC) Secretary General Dr Peter Mathuki in Arusha. “By cultivating in them the learning culture and instilling in them the technics of selfemployment, the youth will benefit but the bank will also reap many benefits that have been made by the bank itself,” said Ms Kilama. She said that the bank found it more useful to offer the training as it would lead the youth to reproduce the capital advanced and plough back while repaying partly when business continues. “We do not just offer capital to someone for business… we guide them to learn efficiency and productivity and see on the ground how they go about and grow businesswise,” the KCB senior official noted. Ms Kilama said KCB Tanzania also has a responsibility, and actually is creating conducive environment for women to improve their businesses. To realise that, KCB in Tanzania has come up with a special account for women that goes by a name ‘2JIAJIRI WOMEN’. One of regular customers with the bank, Ms Haika Kyejo, commended the bank for its efforts to serve special groups and generally for offering an outstanding performance through its good system. KCB Public Relations Manager Ms Delvina Minja assured all customers resident in Tanzania to access best services even beyond as the bank offers maintains a good banking network throughout all EAC partner states
