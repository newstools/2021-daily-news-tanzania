The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office, Policy, Parliament, Labour, Employment, Youth and the Disabled, Jenista Mhagama said also the value of the fund had increased to 4.8tri/- in last year from 3.2tri/- in 2018. The minister attributed the success to the improvements made in 2018 in the social security sector. Thus, the minister said, currently the government aimed at a system that would support collections, investment and benefits that are in line with the current needs for NSSF members. And, Ms Mhagama called on the NSSF staff to work in line with the fund's mission and vision which focuses on providing quality services to members.
