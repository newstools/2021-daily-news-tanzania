THE construction of a 1.15bn/- modern slaughterhouse in Iringa Municipality is expected to be completed in August this year, the government said. Deputy Minister, President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government (Health), Festo Dugange said that construction of the slaughter house which started in 2008/2009 fiscal year is meant to improve hygiene and supply quality meat to consumers. He told Members of Parliament that by 2018, the construction of the slaughter house had spent a total of 929m/, including 550m/- from the Central Government, 108m/- from the Iringa Municipal internal revenue, 101m/- through the country’s Agricultural Sector Development Programme (ASDP) and 169m/- from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO). Mr Dugange was responding to a question from Iringa Urban MP Jesca Msambatavangu (CCM), who sought to know the government’s plan to complete the strategic project of constructing the modern abattoir in Iringa Ngerewela. The lawmaker said that lack of modern slaughter houses was not only affecting supply of quality meat to consumers, but also incomes of livestock keepers and traders because they fail to process more meat due to limited space. The deputy minister said: “In the financial year 2019/20, the Ngerewela abattoir project was included in the council’s strategic projects aimed at enhancing revenue collections in the municipality. Infrastructures that have so far been built include Oxidation Ponds, preslaughter barn, waste disposal facility, administration building, fence, incinerator, laboratory and laundry building.” Dugange said that construction of more modern abattoirs will further advance the processing capabilities within the relevant industrial value chains. “The government is implementing several projects to construct modern slaughterhouses in various areas in the country so as to ensure that our communities are supplied with quality meat and other related products."
