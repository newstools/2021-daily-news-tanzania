TEACHERS Service Commission (TSC) has called upon the government to assist in the establishment of a comprehensive system in which already employed teachers will further acquire high degree codes of professionalism. The request was made here yesterday by TSC Executive Secretary, Ms Paulina Nkwama, while briefing the Permanent Secretary in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Prof Riziki Shemdoe, when meeting the commission’s management. In having TSC as a public entity that caters for the welfare of teachers national, Ms Nkwama noted that creating such a system will help teachers to get extra skill that is vital in their line of duty. In a related development, Prof Shemdoe urged the public to remain calm and wait for the government notification on the employment of 6,000 teachers. Elaborating, he said the government has not announced procedures for the employment of teachers, alerting that the public should be aware of conmen saying the recruitment has started. “President Samia Suluhu Hassan directed us to recruit 6,000 teachers. We have not issued any statement so far as we are completing some logistics before announcing the posts. “The government is finalising how the exercise should be undertaken and will announce procedures to the public. We have to ensure we have a system and procedures that would assure us of quality and best teachers who will be committed to serving the public,” he pointed out. Elaborating, the PS noted that the government is doing assessment to know the number of schools with serious shortages of teachers, before recruiting a special team of disciplined and committed ones. On his part, Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Science, Technology, Mr Gerald Mweli commended TSC for taking prompt decisions on a number of disciplinary issues submitted to it.
