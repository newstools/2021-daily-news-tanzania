Simba SC have finally climbed to the top of the Tanzania’s Premier League table after a 1-0 victory against hosts Gwambina FC at Gwambina Complex in Mwanza. Following Simba's win, their rivals Yanga have automatically dropped to the second position of the league after enjoying it for a couple of months. Mohammed Hussein’s long range volley landed at the back of Gwambina’s nets as Simba ascended to the top of the table with 58 points. Their rival Yanga has collected 57 points followed by third placed Azam with 51. Yanga may reclaim the top seat only if they register a victory against Azam FC at Mkapa Stadium on Sunday night.
