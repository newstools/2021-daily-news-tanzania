THE Ministry of Agriculture is planning to put into place strategies of nationals having the capacity to harvest rainwater that meets the agricultural irrigation standards countrywide. According to the ministry’s Officer Ms Daines Mtei the end goal is to increase and guarantee food production chain throughout the year especially for maize, rice and sugarcane. She said the strategy will motivate and build the capacity of the people to collect enough rainwater and drill also several wells capable of addressing impacts of global climate change on food production. “Productive farming should not only rely on rainy season,” said Ms Mtei at a virtual workshop on the impacts of Covid-19 responses on the political economy of African food systems. Besides the rainwater harvest project, she said the ministry through its several institutions will continue to conduct quality seed researches and called upon the Agricultural Science Association (ASA) to increase seed production to meet the needs of farmers. She noted that the research findings conducted by the Eastern and Southern Africa Small-scale Farmers’ Forum (ESAFF) and sponsored by the International Research Development Center (IDRC) focus mostly on exchanging information about Covid-19 and its impact on food production, transportation, exports and food patterns. On his part, ESAFF Coordinator, Joel Mzinga, said Tanzania continues to have food surplus pointing out 2020/21 in comparison to most Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. In depth he cited some 10 SADC countries as Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Zambia among them facing hunger, including 11.8 million people in South Africa. In East Africa, 1.2 million people in Kenya were facing food shortages.
