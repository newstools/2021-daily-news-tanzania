CAF Confederation Cup representatives, Namungo are back in international contest as they welcome Raja Casablanca at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam today. The country’s envoys will be hunting to get their first win of the group stage campaign as they remain winless in their past four matches hence; sitting at the bottom of their group D table. In their past meeting in Morocco, Namungo went down 1-0 as such, they will be looking forward to revenge the painful loss they suffered against a team which has already qualified into the quarterfinals of the contest. After that, they succumbed to another disappointing 2-0 loss from Pyramids before stamping a back to back 1-0 loss to Zambian side Nkana FC. Nicknamed ‘Southern Killers’, Namungo have had a bumpy ride in the group stage of the competition in comparison with the way they performed in the last qualification phase. To march into the last 16, they overrun de Agosto courtesy of a 7-5 aggregate victory which simply opened up a new chapter in the club’s football history. This was what every Tanzanian hoped for to see their team parading in the group stage of the high profile football showpiece but now, their chances to reach the promised land look very slim. If Namungo win today, they will end Raja Casablanca’s unbeaten run in four games they have played in group D and are the only side to win their four opening matches among all 16 teams trading the unfolding group stages. With their impressive performance, no wonder they lead group D log with 12 points seconded by Pyramids which have garnered six points while Nkana sit third on the ladder with 6 points as well. With two matches remaining, one can plainly see that the chances for Namungo to sail into the last eight are very slim basing on the available standings. Namungo won the privilege to play in this season’s confederation cup after being finalists in the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) where they lost 2-1 to Simba.
