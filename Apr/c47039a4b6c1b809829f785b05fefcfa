THE Moshi Resident Magistrate’s Court has sentenced Poland national Damian Krzysztof and his wife Eliwaza Pyuza, a Tanzanian, to 90 years imprisonment after convicting them of three counts of cultivating 729 cannabis plants and trafficking in 7.2 kilogramme of the drugs. Furthermore, the court also sentenced three accused persons, including Pyuza, Hanif Kanani and Boniface Kessy, all Tanzanians to three years imprisonment or pay a fine of 4m/- each, after they were found guilty of using cannabis, commonly known as bhang. Head of the Government Communication Unit of the Drug Control and Enforcement Authority (DCEA) Florence Khambi said in a statement to the media yesterday that the verdict was handed down on April 9, 2021 before Principal Resident Magistrate Bernazitha Maziku. The Court also ordered the confiscation Krzysztof’s oneand-a-half-hectare farm situated in Himo Njia Panda area, a sum of 26,765,000/- cash seized from him, and two plastic containers found with bhang as well as a KTM Adventure motorcycle with registration number MC 972 AAD. In addition, the court further ordered the destruction of two 2000-liter simtanks used to irrigate cannabis seedlings on the farm in question and the entire amount of narcotic drugs seized. The magistrate is quoted in the statement as saying that the court convicted the accused on the charges against them after considering the evidence presented by both parties and became satisfied that the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were involved in the drug’s business. In the judgment, the magistrate said that the evidence presented in court by 11 prosecution witnesses was sufficient and, thus, ordered the couple to serve the 30 years in prison for each of the three counts they were charged with of cultivation bhang and trafficking in drugs. However, Magistrate Maziku ordered the sentences imposed on each count to run co-currently, meaning that such convicts would remain behind bars for only 30 years instead of 90 years.
