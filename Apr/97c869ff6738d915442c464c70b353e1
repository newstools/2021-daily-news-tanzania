MTIBWA Sugar have failed to maintain recent consistency in the Mainland Premier League after losing 1-2 to Polisi Tanzania at Jamhuri Stadium in Morogoro. The sugarcane growers recently beat Coastal Union of Tanga 2-0 but could not maintain their winning spree before Polisi Tanzania. The win was a wake-up call for Polisi Tanzania after their recent 0-1 defeat from tailing Mbeya City. That was also the second head to head defeat for Mtibwa Sugar to suffer in six months after their last meeting with Polisi Tanzania in November last year. They also lost 0-1. The Morogoro-based Premier League outfit, Mtibwa Sugar have had unimpressive run this season with un-compelling results. In their three other previous matches, they drew 1-1 with Kagera Sugar, lost 0-5 to league leaders Simba Sports Club ( with 58 points) and lost 0-2 to third placed Azam FC ( with 54 points). They are at 14th out 18 teams in the league with 28 points from 26 matches they played so far, signalling that they have to pull up their socks to avoid sinking further to the relegation zone that is so far linking JKT Tanzania ( 27 points) , Kagera Sugar ( 27) , Mbeya City (27) and Mwadui FC with 16 points. Meanwhile, Biashara United have cemented their fourth place in the standing with 44 points after beating Kagera Sugar 2-1 Biashara got their goals from Deogratius Judika in the 24th minute and Lenny Kisu in the 28th minute were enough to give them three points. Vitalisy Mayanga scored for Kagera Sugar six minutes to time.
