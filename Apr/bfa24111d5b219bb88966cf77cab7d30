He added that the construction of the Katesh bus terminal is among 20 strategic projects in the country whose implementation stalled during 2019/2020 because of several challenges which occurred during that period. “The government looked for solutions on the challenges after forming a team of experts which later came up with several recommendations on how best the projects could be implemented,” he said.

Therefore, after verification of the documents the ministry shall disburse the money for the project,” Mr Silinde said.
