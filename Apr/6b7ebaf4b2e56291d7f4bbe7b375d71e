MINISTRY of Finance and Planning in collaboration with the State Mining Corporation (STAMICO) has completed verification of 1bn/- that former Kiwira Coal Mine workers owe the state in salaries and other benefits. Deputy Minister for Minerals Prof Shukrani Manya said in Parliament that verification of outstanding debts was completed in June 2019, adding that all payment procedures were being coordinated by the treasury. He was responding to a question by Kyela legislator Ally Mlaghila (CCM) who wanted to know when the government would revive operation at Kiwira Coal Mine. The MP also demanded to know when former staff at the company would be paid their money in outstanding debts and other stipends. In his response, the minister said Kiwira Coal Mine was handed over to the government through STAMICO in 2013 so that the state mining firm could help the then cash-strapped company. He added that currently STAMICO and the state-run power utility, TANESCO, were continuing with its long plan for the implementation of the project for the production of 200MW of electricity through coal that will be produced from Kiwira. “A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between TANESCO and STAMICO is at its final stages of signing before the documents are availed to the Attorney General (AG) for approval,” he said. The deputy minister further said that already experts from STAMICO and TANESCO made a working tour at the project site and received an assessment report on how to execute the project and the repair of infrastructure. “Because of the scope of this project, the two state companies are still looking on funding for investment from different development partners as well as engaging the central government to see how funding can be allocated from the main budget," he added.
