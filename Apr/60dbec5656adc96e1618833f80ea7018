TO ensure preservation and sustainability of the natural vegetation and organisms in the government protected areas, surrounding communities have been asked to stop encroaching in them with their economic activities. Issuing the alert, Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Marry Masanja in Tabora, recently said the government will continue evicting people farming and keeping their livestock in the protected areas. Speaking to Isawima village residents in Kaliua District in Tabora region, during a tour to inspect Isawima Forest, she further said any invasion of conserved areas threatens sustainability of the natural vegetation as habitat of wild animals in them. Equally, she said conservation requires collaborative efforts between the government and the general public especially the surrounding communities in the areas. “The government has been setting aside some areas for the conservation of wild animals and vegetation, but still some people turn them to fertile areas for their crops and livestock…the government will never hesitate to remove them,” said Ms Masanja. Elaborating, she asked the public to play a major role in protecting the government entities, adding that they attract tourists, promote investments and increase revenue collections to the State. “We are protecting these areas with the aim of ensuring the sustainability of water sources as well as attracting investors and generate income for improvement of other social services including education, health, electricity, infrastructure and water. “I would like to call upon all of us to adhere to the rules, regulations and laws of our country, and we must make sure these areas are well protected,” she pointed out. In another development, the deputy minister told the villagers surrounding the forest to only harvest the crops already planted, thereafter, apply for permits for any agriculture activities in the area.
