MBEYA Kwanza coach Steve Matata has hailed his charges for the impressive First Division League (FDL) performance, leading to their promotion into the Mainland Premier League next season. The Mbeya-based side were guaranteed a slot in the top flight league courtesy of a 1-0 victory over African Sports at Mabatini Stadium over the weekend. The outcome saw them reaching 38 points which can never be reached by any team packed in group A of the FDL. Speaking on the sound victory, Matata repeatedly praised his players for the good performance which enabled them to trade in the elite league. “It’s pleasing to see that finally, we have managed to successfully accomplish our mission,” “It was not that easy to fulfill this dream since we faced strong teams on our way up,” he said. Asked whether he is going to be with the team in the Mainland Premier League, he replied that his initial contract with team owners was to drive the team into the top flight league. “Our agreement was to drive the team to the Premier League, so I’m not sure about my future so far,” he said. He also narrated that his desire, despite leading the team to the Premier league prematurely was to make sure that they win all their formal remaining three matches. Matata was the man who drove Tanzania Prisons into the Mainland Premier League and has that reputation of navigating teams into the top flight leagues. As it stands in group A, African Sports are second with 28 points after 15 matches while Kengold sit on 3rd slot with 26 points after the same number of encounters. Ndanda are fourth with 20 points while African Lyon occupy fifth slot after bagging 18 points from 15 matches they have played this season.
