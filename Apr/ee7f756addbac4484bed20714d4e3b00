LACK of knowledge on how to register using the ‘Online’ technology to get Identity Cards (IDs), has been cited as a major problem facing most of the petty traders in Kagera Region. In a cross-interview conducted by this newspaper, the petty traders popularly known as "Wamachinga", appealed to the Municipal and District Council authorities to conduct a sensitisation seminar and educate them how to register themselves using ‘Online’ technology. Edmund Tibabimare (24), a petty trader at the Bukoba Central Market commended the late President John Magufuli for initiating efforts to issue the petty traders with IDs by paying a mere 20,000/- annual fee. "We commend the late President John Magufuli for his efforts to ensure the petty traders conduct business in conducive environment.
