A BUBARE secondary school teacher in Missenyi District, Bashiru Ali (32), has been convicted of raping and impregnating a Form Two girl student and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. Prosecuting State Attorney Nehemia John told the court during hearing of the case that the convict (Ali), committed the offence in November, last year. He told the court that Ali raped the girl (name withheld), who was aged 16 years old, a Form Two student at Bubare secondary school and impregnated her. He prayed for a deterrent sentence contending that the offence denied the victim the right to attend school. Before passing the sentence, Bukoba Resident Magistrate, Joseph Luambano noted that the prosecution side had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. Meanwhile, Rashid Mboneki (32), a resident of Muleba District’s Nyamilanda village was convicted of raping a Standard Five pupil (name withheld), and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. Prosecuting Police Inspector Peter Ndemu told the court during hearing of the case that the convict committed the offence on September 20, last year. He told the court that Mboneki raped the girl who was aged 15-years old, a Standard Five pupil at Burigi primary school and impregnated her before marrying her. In a related development, Kusekwa Madaha (27), a resident of Kyerwa District’s Murongo village is helping police investigations for allegedly impregnating a Standard Four Pupil (name withheld). Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi explained that the suspect would be arraigned before the court when investigations are completed. In the analysis, impregnating a student is considered as rape and forms part of genderbased violence (GBV) against women and children. It constitutes a breach of their fundamental right to life, liberty, security and dignity.
