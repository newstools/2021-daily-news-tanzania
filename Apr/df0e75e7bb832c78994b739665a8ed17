THE government has directed local government authorities to ensure public health centres under their jurisdictions spend well the revenues that are collected as a result of cost-sharing in provision of health services. Deputy Minister of State in the President’s Office, (Regional Administration and Local Governments), Dr Festo Ndugange, also instructed that at least 50 per cent of the collected funds should be channeled to buying medicines and medical devices. “I also urge Members of Parliament to closely monitor uses of medicines in health centres in their areas and continue cooperating with the government to ensure the revenues are well spent,” Dr Ndugange stated here in the Parliament. The deputy minister was responding to concerns from some Mps over shortage of drugs in health centres in their constituencies. Some of the Mps who raised the concern included Ali Jumbe (Kyela-CCM), and Special-Seats MP Esther Midimu. The MPs commended the government for increasing the budget for drugs during the last five years, but noted that some health centres were still facing shortages. The Deputy Minister said the government has improved availability of drugs in health facilities from 60 per cent in 2015 to 90 per cent during this financial year, saying the aim is to continue improving health services by strengthening collection of revenues in the health facilities and continue allocating enough funds to the Medical Stores Department (MSD). He further stated that the government has built many health centres in the last five years and now puts efforts in increasing the number of staff. “This is in line with looking for more funds to purchase medical devices for health centres that have been built and renovated but did not get funds for buying medical devices,” he noted.
