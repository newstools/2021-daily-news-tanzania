TANZANIA Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) has won 163 cases out of 328 filed against it in the past two years. According to Tanesco Chief Legal Counsel, Advocate Amosi Ndegi, the winning of the cases has helped the state power utility firm to save 21bn/-. Ndegi who also doubles as the Company Secretary said that in the past two financial years 2018/19 and 2020/21, the company was facing 328 cases which were filed in different zones across the country. But, he said between May 2019/20 and April 2021, the utility firm won about 163 cases while 165 cases were still pending in courts. Advocate Ndegi further noted that out of the pending cases, Dar es Salaam Zone is leading by having 49 cases compared to the Northern zone regions including Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Manyara which altogether have a total of 15 cases. He, however, said that within the said period, TANESCO paid 424bn/- for losing some cases. The Company Secretary further elaborated that the amount of money paid for losing the cases is small compared to the funds the company saved after winning the ceases in 2019/20 fiscal and 2020/21 fiscal year amounting to 21bn/- Equally, Advocate Ndegi said that the company used various strategies to ensure that they win the cases, such as collaborating with the government legal officers, amendment of some company’s laws that provide it legal immunity of not being sued regularly and legal awareness of the company’s internal officers. “Earlier, the company incurred loss because it paid people who sued it, but after realising that the company was getting losses we took initiatives to look for alternative ways to protect the company,”
