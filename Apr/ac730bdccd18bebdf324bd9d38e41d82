Minister for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development William Lukuvi presented the title deeds for the Dodoma-based parliamentary buildings to the Speaker Job Ndugai urging state institutions to ensure they obtain the crucial documents. Speaking Sunday shortly after handing over the documents the minister demanded public institutions to survey and map their land with appropriate documentation. He thanked the National Assembly Speaker for taking the necessary steps that can help prevent unnecessary land conflicts with other landlords. The Minister also urged the general public with whom their property have not been formalized to do the needful and pay the relevant land taxes on time.
