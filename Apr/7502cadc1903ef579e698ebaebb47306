SHE has ascended to the highest position in her political party, the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi, after trekking a long journey in politics. The first ever female chairperson of one of Africa’s oldest political movements, 61-year-old Samia Suluhu Hassan, has made her own unique history in the CCM family. The incumbent President of the United Republic of Tanzania got all the blessings from her party’s top organ, the National Executive Committee, to hold the chairpersonship. In 2000, Samia was elected as a member of the Zanzibar House of Representatives for Special Seats and appointed as Minister by President Amani Abeid Karume. She was the only high-ranking woman minister in the cabinet. In 2005, she was re-elected and appointed minister, while in 2010, she contested and won by more than 80 per cent and represented Makunduchi constituency. In 2014, the then President of the Union Government Dr Jakaya Kikwete appointed her as Minister of State in the Vice-President’s Office responsible for Union Matters. In the same year, she was elected as the Vice-Chairperson of the Constituent Assembly tasked to draft the country’s new constitution. In July 2015, the CCM Presidential candidate, the late Dr John Magufuli named Samia as his running mate for the 2015 General Election, making her the first female running mate in the party’s history and the first female Vice-President in the country. Ms Samia was nominated for the second time as Dr Magufuli’s running mate in the 2020 General Election and continued serving as Vice-President after her party won a landslide victory. She served in the position for hardly five months before she was sworn in as Tanzania’s first female President following the death of her predecessor Dr Magufuli. Ms Samia is today expected to be endorsed as CCM National Chairperson by the party’s National Congress.
