A RECENT investigation by security officials in Tarime District has established that no person was found dead or alive at North Mara Gold Mine pits contrary to claims in the public. Mara Regional Commissioner (RC) Mr Adam Malima told a news conference in his office that the rumours were mere speculations by people with bad intention. “I want to assure you that such a thing did not happen. People with bad intention speculate only false things,” he said in a meeting attended the regional defence and security committee in the area. Instead, the RC ordered five traders to surrender before the Tarime/Rorya Regional Police Commander (RPC) for allegedly mobilising people to invade the gold mine to steal gold sand. The regional chief named the suspects and areas where they live in brackets as Raphael Zacharia (Bweriin Musoma District), Keraha Chona (Nyamongo, Tarime District), Makenge Nyaisa (NyamwagaTarime), Manasa Phelemon (Busweli in Mwanza city ) and Nyagwisi Marwa of Tarime. “Investigation is underway and we need these people to surrender to the Tarime/Rorya RPC,” Mr Malima ordered. Unsubstantiated claims have been spreading that several men were feared dead at the gold mine now for some days forcing the regional security officials to work around the clock to clarify that. North Mara gold mine is now operated by Barrick Gold Corporation in partnership with the government of Tanzania through Twiga Minerals Corporation
