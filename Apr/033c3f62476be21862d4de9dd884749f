The Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Ethics Committee has banned Young Africans SC Vice Chairman from engaging in sports activities for five years for misconduct. Official statement issued by the Federation on Friday, Mwakalebela has been fined 5,000,000/- after being found guilty of making inflammatory remarks geared to inciting fans, members and supporters of the Dar es Salaam based club contrary to the soccer governing body in the country. The statement said in the second indictment Mwakalebela lied to reporters on October 1, 2020 that he had a contract between player Bernard Morrison and Simba Sports club. The statement added that Mwakalebela claimed at a press conference in Dar es Salaam, on February 19, 2021, that TFF was sabotaging Young Africans and has, however, failed to prove it. It is also claimed that Mwakalebela presented a fake contract between Bernard Morrison and Young Africans. TFF has also fined him 2,000,000/- for the offence and warned Mwakalebela not to repeat the same within fiveÂ years.
