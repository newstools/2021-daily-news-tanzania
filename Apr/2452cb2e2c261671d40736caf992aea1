WORKS and Transport Deputy Minister Mwita Waitara has issued a 14-day ultimatum to Tanzania Port Authority(TPA) Director General, Eric Hamisi to submit to him a report of Tanga Port expansion and development project implementation. The deputy minister was seemingly dismayed by a snail pace on the completion of the project, and equally wanted to verify its value for money implementation that involved strengthening, deepening and modernisation of existing berth no I and II built by China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC). Mr Waitara noted that the report should contain analysis of the project from bids’ competition, consultation and those involved in the project preparations. Deputy Minister Waitara issued the order after his visit to the port to inspect the progress of the project. However, he expressed his dismay for what he termed as sluggishness in implementation of the project and sniffed embezzlement. He said the government disbursed about 172bn/- for dredging of berth number I and II and another 256bn/- for expansion of dockyard, but still it was not completed. “The government injected a lot of money into this project and still ships are not anchoring at the port area, still there is double handling cost, a matter which lead businessmen to opt for Mombasa Port in Kenya,” said Mr Waitara. He said the main objective of Tanga Port expansion is to reduce congestion at Dar es Salaam Port. In a related development, he tasked the DG Hamisi to take legal and disciplinary measures against embezzlers at the port(s) and make sure that there was no loophole. On his side the TPA boss pledged to work on all the directives, saying the report will be submitted to the government immediately after gathering all required information. Commenting, China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) contractor, Liu Wei promised to complete the remaining work timely and hand it over before the end of this year
