Zanzibar President Dr Hussein Mwinyi has revoked appointment of three commanders of Special Units as a probe committee’s report unmasks 381 ghost workers from various departments in the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (SMZ), who were paid over 2bn/- monthly. A press statement issued by the State House late on Monday said the President has annulled appointments of Zanzibar Training College Commander Ali Abdallah Ali, Head of Zanzibar National Service (JKU) Col Ali Mtumweni Hamad and head of Special Anti-Smuggling Unit (KMKM), Comodore Hassan Mussa Mzee. The statement quoted President Mwinyi as saying he decided to form a special committee to assess number of staff and their respective salaries in various SMZ units. Presidential Committee revealed that in December, 2020, over 300m/- were paid as allowances to ghost workers. It was uncovered that some officials were using various techniques to register ghost workers including giving young men the army uniforms before photographing them to prove that they were bona fide government employees.
