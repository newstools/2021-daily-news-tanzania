The Duke of Sussex is returning to the UK to attend the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral on Saturday. It's the first time that Prince Harry has visited the UK since he and his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last March. The Duke of Sussex will be following COVID-19 protocols for travel in both directions as well as during his time in the country. The Duke of Sussex will be unaccompanied when he attends the service for his grandfather, who died last Friday at the age of 99. The funeral will be held at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace says Prince Harry's wife, Meghan, will remain at their home in California. The Duchess of Sussex is pregnant with their second child, and has been advised by her doctor not to travel.
