The UN Secretary said the late Dr Magufuli’s administration improved rural electrification in the country, with ambitions to expand Tanzania’s electricity generation capacity to enable nationwide energy access. “On behalf of the United Nations, I once again offer our condolences to the late president’s family, the government and people of the United Republic of Tanzania,” remarked Mr Guterres. Moreover, the UN Assembly expressed recognition to the country’s long history of support for multilateralism and applauded its dedication to international and regional cooperation. Mr Guterres said the UN Assembly reiterates its commitment of continuing to work closely with President Samia Suluhu Hassan, saying the UN stands with Tanzania in advancing sustainable development. “I take this opportunity to reiterate and reinforce the commitment of the United Nations to continue working closely with his successor, President Samia Suhulu Hassan, the country’s first female President.

On his part, the Permanent Representative of Tanzania to the UN, Prof Kennedy Gastorn said the late President Magufuli was a towering figure who inspired many across the world, and spoke truth to power, and did so through tough love and in the tradition of humility. He said: “he will always stand out as an unrelenting and a hard-working leader, a true patriot and great statesman with a humble and selfless disposition,” Prof Gastorn told the UN Assembly that the late Dr Magufuli was a paragon of virtues, an economic national who believed unapologetically on self-development. “Dr Magufuli was a visionary leader and an ardent Pan Africanist who believed that Tanzania, Africans and the entire humanity deserved the best,” said Prof Gastorn.
