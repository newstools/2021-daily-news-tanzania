AZAM’s lethal striker Prince Dube has again ascended to the top of the season’s Premier League scorers’ chart with ten goals in his bag as the race for golden boot heats up. He fired a brace on Friday night when his side over-ran Kagera Sugar 2-0 at Azam Complex in Dar es Salaam a victory which saw the hosts sitting second on the table dislodging defending champions Simba with the latter moving to third slot. Nicknamed Smiling Killer, the Zimbabwean hit-man has had a massive season in the ongoing top flight league and had it not been the injury he picked at a certain point in the contest, he could have probably been very far on the scoring table. However, looking at the side mirror, he sees two Simba net bursters John Bocco and Meddie Kagere getting closer to him as the duo have netted nine goals apiece. Leaving aside the splint for the championship, another area of concentration by many football fans is who will win the top goal scorer award at the end of the campaign. Kagere will be searching to retain the golden boot prize for three consecutive seasons and with the current scoring trend, he is not very far from achieving that feat. To emerge a top goal scorer in a particular league usually become one’s good selling platform when it comes to crossing a line to play for another team and it attracts huge sums of money. Azam who refuse to give up the season’s title challenge have so far played 25 matches to collect 47 points in the process and they lately accommodate second place with one point above Simba. For Kagera Sugar, they desperately needed maximum three points from the match to reignite their chances of staying put in the league next season but things went in an opposite direction.
