Additionally, President Museveni, said Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) played an important role in removing  Iddi Amin from the power. “.....Tanzania route was not in the picture, we were still debating about Mombasa and Lamu of Kenya. "The historical role of Tanzania in the liberation of Uganda in both 1978/1979 and 1985/86. On this two occasion Mwalimu Nyerere played a very important role. In the 1978/79 in the war , TPDF played a major role in removing Idd Amin from power, “ said President Museveni. President Museveni said he is more pleased with the fact that the Project will highly contribute to the development of Tanzania while saying that Tanzania’s contribution in Uganda cannot be compensated. “I am more satisfied that the project will make a modest contribution to the development of Tanzania. It cannot compensated for the huge sacrifice Tanzania made for the defeat of Iddi Amin and the liberation of whole of Southern Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and South Africa. It is just a modest contribution,“ he added.
