THE National Electoral Commission (NEC) has announced that the by-election in Muhambwe and Buhigwe constituencies in Kigoma and other 18 wards will be held on May 16, this year. The commission is seeking to fill the vacuum left by MP Atashasta Nditiye who passed away on 12 February, and Dr Philip Mpango, who was picked by President Samia Suluhu Hassan to become the Vice-President on March 30, this year. NEC Director of Elections, Dr Wilson Mahera told reporters that Tanzanians who wish to contest for the said posts are invited to collect forms between April 24th and 30th, this year. He said the campaigns will kick off from may 1 to may 15 and that the votes will be casted on May 16. “These processes also involve 18 wards on which wananchi will get opportunities to elect chancellors in different regions,” he noted. Dr Mahera said the by-election for Muhabwe Constituency has been pushed forward to May 16th instead of May 2 as it was announced before. “The nominations for Muhambwe constituency candidates have already taken place, the contestants are therefore waiting for the date to start the campaigns,” he said. According to Dr Mahera, the approved candidates are from Chama cha Mapinduzi, Alliance for Change and Transparency (ACT-Wazalendo) and Democratic Party (DP). He said voters will vote for new chancellors a few months after general election due to the deaths, resignation and disqualification of some chancellors on citizenship bases. He named the involved wards in the coming by-elections as Bugalama and Buziku in Geita region. Igusele, Igunga and Mmale in Tabora region. Others are Jana ward (Shinyanga), Miuta (Mtwara), Ligoma (Ruvuma), Engutoto (Arusha), Iwiji (Mbeya), Kisiwani (Tanga), Matembwe (Njombe), Sagara (Dodoma),Mhezi (Kilimanjaro), Kagera Nkanda and Nyakitonto in Kigoma.
