TANZANIA Scout Association (TSA) is planning to hold a national prayer for the departed President John Magufuli, including praying for the new President Samia Suluhu Hassan. “TSA invites all 400 scouts in the country and members of the public to take part in prayers for the nation at regional and district levels on April 6, 2021,” Chief Scout Ms Mwantumu Mahiza told reporters on Thursday. The chief scout elaborated that the prayers will last for one hour and will take place in Zanzibar and Tanzania mainland. “I call for Scouts’ district commissioners to take all the necessary arrangements to ensure prayers take place in their areas. Guests of honour will be district commissioners and regional commissioners across the country,” she said. According to Ms Mahiza, TSA believes President Samia needs prayers so that she can lead the country successfully. Ms Mahiza said Dar es Salaam region will hold its prayers at Karimjee hall where regional commissioner will attend as the chief guest. Meanwhile, Ms Mahiza applauded scouts and TSA members for the job well done during the death and funeral procession of former President John Magufuli. She said that scouts members did a laudable job in ushering mourners and were at the forefront in assuring that first aid services were available to the needy and therefore ensuring safety. “Scouts used their time, energy and zeal to honour their oaths of serving their nation and ensure smooth flow of president Magufuli burial precessions,” she noted.
