MORE than 5,000 teachers are set to be distributed in various schools in the country facing shortage of the professionals, the government has said. Deputy Minister for Education, Science and Technology, Juma Kipanga told the House here that last year the government through Regional Administration and Local Government employed more than 8,000 teachers. He added that most of the teachers employed were allocated to schools with critical shortage of the professionals, especially in rural areas. “The government is still working on the shortage of teachers, there are more than 5000 teachers who will be dispatched to various areas in the country as efforts to address the problem” he said. Mr Kipanga was responding to a supplementary question by Special Seats MP Husna Sekiboko (CCM), who wanted to know why the government was using the same grading system for schools in rural and urban areas while students in rural areas were facing numerous challenges, including shortage of teachers. Early February Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa told the National Assembly that last year the government employed 13, 000 teachers, and 8000 were assigned to duty stations to address the shortage. He assured of the government commitment to employing teachers to meet public needs and improve service delivery. The PM said that it was the government’s intention that a teacher had a few classes so that he/she can have ample time to concentrate on students. “We will keep on employing teachers depending on demand to ensure that those employed are not overburdened to increase efficiency,” he said. Mr Kipanga said that the grading system used in the country has taken into account the national, regional and international standards. He said that the government cannot change the grading criteria but it will work on the challenges facing rural schools by allocating more teachers and improve the learning environment.
