Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II’s husband, has died aged 99, Buckingham Palace has announced. A statement issued by the palace just after midday spoke of the Queen’s “deep sorrow” following his death at Windsor Castle on Friday morning. The Duke of Edinburgh, who was the longest-serving consort in British history, had returned to Windsor on 16 March after a month in hospital. “It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty the Queen announces the death of her beloved husband,” the palace said. “The Royal Family joins with people around the world in mourning his loss.” Speaking at Downing Street, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he “inspired the lives of countless young people”. He said Prince Phillip has earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth, and around the world. Meanwhile, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said he “consistently put the interests of others ahead of his own and, in so doing, provided an outstanding example of Christian service”.
