PUMA Energy Tanzania has increased its number of petrol stations by 19 per cent from 52 to 62 stations for the past five months in efforts to extend its wing in the fuel business in the country. The company is owned jointly by the government and the Puma Investments Ltd, each with a share ownership of 50 per cent. According to the Company’s Retail Manager Venessy Chilambo, from January this year, Puma Energy Tanzania has established ten new petrol stations in the regions of Kagera, Morogoro, Dar es Salaam, and Tanga. “We are planning to expand our operation network to other locations across the country in order to bring our services closer to customers,” she said when briefing journalists in Dar es Salaam. She said the move was in keeping with the company’s promise of delivering on the last mile to bring its brand purpose of ‘Energising Communities’ to drive growth and prosperity. “We firmly believe in the need to support communities by making access to affordable fuels and lubricants with the right quality across the width and breadth of the country,” she added. The company further vowed to seek to achieve its brand purpose through its growth and expansion to ensure many communities are carried along and impacted positively. Meanwhile, the company resorted to 24-hour operations for all its petrol stations countrywide as competitiveness in the fuel business hots up. Initially, some of its stations were offering services round-the-clock, but the new move will enable all of them to adopt the system. “Since the Sixth Phase government’s theme emphasizes that work should continue, we therefore decided to come up with a different approach meant to carry on with hard work,” Ms Chilambo told the media.
