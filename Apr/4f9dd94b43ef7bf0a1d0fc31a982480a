IN Mainland Tanzania, home to approximately 125 different ethnic groups, largely Christian and Muslim communities speaking a common language of Kiswahili, history has it that on 26th April, 1964, it emerged in a voluntary union with Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanzania that has continued to offer several benefits to citizens of both sides. Looked at keenly, since then the youth who form the majority born after independence and the union have collectively and peacefully participated in the two states’ political stabilities as one common country and that has enhanced different businesses to flourish, and hence, eke out a living. For that matter, the brains behind the union- the first President of Tanganyika, the late Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere, and the first Zanzibar President, the late Sheikh Abeid Amani Karume, deserve accolades posthumously. Their school of thought since then has brought unity that has strengthened all sectors in life to the extent that all citizens practice intermarriages and no longer identify themselves with their ethnic communities and such tiny states. As this is hailed, peace as an ingredient has found itself being a component that has provided an opportunity for both sides’ citizens to communicate freely and no longer see a Zanzibari as a stranger/foreigner and likewise a Mainland as an alien. When one looks at the union benefits, tolerance features as one of advantages the citizens have continued to enjoy and no longer feel divided by political parties, religion, you name it and instead feel coming together to celebrate it, because it is their child being born on the day. In a way there may be several advantages of the Union that is why it has survived to witness its 57th birthday, what remains is for the coming generations to treat it as one of the legacies to maintain in honour of our leaders, who sacrificed their time, energy and lives to make it become a reality. Besides this, the same youths have several business opportunities to exploit in other blocs (read unions) such as the East Africa Community comprising Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan as well as Democratic Republic of Congo now willing to join. The list will not be complete without mentioning the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries of Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe also forming another union with Tanzania.
