THE government now works on report of evaluation on merging funds for providing loans to special groups in the country. The government’s plan to combine those funds is meant to improve their efficiency as well as help more people get out of poverty. Deputy Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Policy Parliamentary Affairs Employment, Youth and the Disabled), Patrobas Katambi, told the Parliament on Monday that they have already received assessment report from a team of experts tasked to do the evaluation. The team involved different ministries in charge of supervising economic empowerment councils. “The final report on what should be done to properly merge the funds has been submitted and that the government would soon rule out the best way to combine them in order to simplify provision of loans,” he stated. Mr Katambi noted this when responding to a question posed by Special Seats lawmaker, Santiel Kirumba (CCM). In her main question, the Special Seats MP demanded the government’s statement as to when the government would unite the Funds in order to facilitate smooth provision of loans to special groups. In his response, Mr Katambi said in total, the country has about 54 different Funds. “The government has 54 funds and empowerment programmes which are divided into four major groups including 16 of them provide direct loans to beneficiaries.’’ The deputy minister added that nine other funds were providing loan guarantees in collaboration with other financial institutions, while 22 funds and seven empowerment programmes were offering subsidies. Out of 54 basket funds, only three have been directly supervised by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
