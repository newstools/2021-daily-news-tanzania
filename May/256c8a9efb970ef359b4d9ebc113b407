AMREF Health Africa has reaffirmed continued support to confront obstetric fistula among women where some 3,000 Tanzanian women develop the health condition every year. Amref said in its statement it had already supported 12,631 women reported to develop obstetric fistula in the past 19 years. “Will continue to support the government of Tanzania to see that obstetric fistula becomes history through joint efforts with partners to have a country strategy about obstetric fistula, availability of current statistics on country situation and appropriate coordination,” it said. Basically, the data on women affected by the unpleasant health condition remains unknown. Comprehensive Community-Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania (CCBRT), an NGO that is one of the country’s largest providers of disability and rehabilitation services reported in 2019, some 3,000 women develop the condition every year. But the international charity organization say it will sustain efforts to support the government in the fight against obstetric fistula. For nearly two decades, Amref has offered medical equipment in 41 regional and district hospitals to ensure women living with fistula get cured. “It also supported the training of 191 health care workers including doctors, assistant medical officers and nurses to ensure the management of obstetric fistulae is done safely and survivors are completely healed.”
