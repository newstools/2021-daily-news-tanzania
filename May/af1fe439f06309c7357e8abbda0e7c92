KATAVI Regional Commissioner (RC) Mr Juma Homera has issued 21 plots valued over 40m/ - to Katavi Regional Press Club (KRPC) to construct their residential houses. The plots have been allocated to journalists who are members of the club. Speaking to the KPRC executive committee members, the RC said one of the plots was special for the construction of KRPC offices. The KRPC committee was led by its chairman, Mr Walter Mgulichuma. Mr Homera said the plots have been offered to journalists in recognition of their good job and that have been playing a big role in revealing various challenges in the region. He urged journalists to continue being professional in undertaking their duties by supporting the government in addressing challenges that face citizens at grass roots. “Journalists should write stories that are credible and useful to the public and region rather than writing stories meant to inciting hatred and conflict in the society,” he added. On his part, Mr Mgulichuma thanked the RC for recognizing journalists’ contribution to both political and social-economic development programmes.
