THE government is making a comprehensive assessment to revamp the poorly performing National Ranching Company Limited (NARCO) so that it can deliver to the country's expectations. The move came following an intensive debate in the August House as Members of Parliament expressed their dismay over the performance of the state owned ranching company. The lawmakers were debating budget estimates for the ministry of Livestock and Fisheries for 2021/2022 financial year. On Friday some MPs, when approving votes for the ministry, demanded the ministry's statement on how it would rescue NARCO, insisting that it was making loss instead of delivering to the expected outcomes. "I think it is not proper for the state to keep animal farms, instead they should be handed over to a local private company if increasing efficiency is anything to go by. However, in his response the Minister acknowledged that NARCO was underperforming and that the government had made a comprehensive assessment to come up with new strategies that can make the company deliver. According to the Minister, 75percent of NARCO farms had been hired by private firms, only 25percent of them were owned by the State. However, he added that even those owned by the government were underperforming. Commenting on the same, Speaker of the National Assembly, Job Ndugai, said over the years NARCO has been underperforming, adding that the company was equally not able to pay land rent. He asked the ministry to come up with Reforms that would see the company coming back in full swing.
