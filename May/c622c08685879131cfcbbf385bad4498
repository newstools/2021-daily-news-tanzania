THE Minister in the Vice President’s Office (Union and Environment) Mr Selemani Jafo has ordered cooperative unions in Tabora to buy tobacco, which has been dried through modern procedures. The Minister was speaking during his official tour in Urambo District, where he inspected conservation of environment. He commended farmers and residents for applying modern technology in drying tobacco instead of using fire woods, which leads to the cutting of trees. “I would like to urge all cooperative unions to buy tobacco that has been dried by using modern technology because it maintains quality and help in preserving environment,” he noted. Earlier, the District Commissioner, Ms Christina Kangwa said that so far many farmers were using modern technology to dry tobacco and that her office was continuing with the campaign to ensure all farmers participate in environment preservation. “Tobacco is one of our cash crops in our region, we need to do everything in our capacity to ensure enough production but at the same time protecting our environment,” she stressed. One of the farmers, Mr Shija Ramadhani said the application of modern technology of drying tobacco had enabled farmers to secure attractive prices for their produce. “ We are happy with this new procedure, our tobacco is now bought at higher price because of its quality, we no longer use firewood and other logs in drying tobacco,” he noted.
