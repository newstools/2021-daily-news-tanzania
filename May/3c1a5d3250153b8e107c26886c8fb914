NATIONAL team, Taifa Stars Head Coach Kim Poulsen said they plan to pitch a ten-day camp in June this year, as the initial phase of preparation for the looming 2022 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. Tanzania is packed in group J of the qualifiers together with DR Congo, Benin and Madagascar with each nation looking for the golden opportunity to qualify for the biggest football showpiece in the world. Initially, the first match of the qualifiers was slated to kick off in June but they have now been pushed further to September this year. “First of all, we fully respect the decision of FIFA and CAF to push further the begging of the qualifiers. We are now waiting for more details from them. “Football is all about preparations and we are using this period to start preparing for September matches. “And, early in June, we will have at least a ten-day camp, since we need to train a lot plus playing international friendly matches,” he said. He continued: “With collaboration from the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), we also want to arrange friendly games in the first round of the preparations. “After that, in mid-August when the Mainland Premier League season will be off, we will recall players for the second phase of preparations with much emphasis being on how to attack, defend and build the team,” Poulsen said. He added that their plan is to play at least two strong friendly matches in August to keep his squad fit before the commencement of the qualifiers in September. “With ample training, we can change many things in the team. We have a good chance now such that when the top flight league season will be concluded, we will use that period for preparations. “I believe that we will be much better than now. It is good to use time wisely for training and preparing the squad. If you train well, you always have big chance to succeed,” he said. Poulsen replaced Burundian Etienne Ndayiragije at the helm of Taifa Stars after the latter was fired for allegedly unconvincing results.
