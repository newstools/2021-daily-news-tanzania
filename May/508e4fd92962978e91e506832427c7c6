FOR the past two weeks, news from different parts of this great country have been dominated by conflicts between herds of elephants and villagers. These fights happen when the largest terrestrial mammals claim their ancestral land which has been grabbed by greedy humans who invade protected areas where elephants used to graze and browse without interference from humans. There may be different causes of these irregular conflicts but conservation activities which have been practiced by the government for more than ten years ago are now paying back, it must be understood that elephants are regarded as one of clever animals on the Earth because of the size of their brain which weighs between 4.5 and 5.5 kilograms, the brain is well developed because it has cerebral cortex which enable the elephant to recognize different odours including the one which was left many years ago by a scent gland of one of an ancestor who walked from central part of Maasai plains to Dukambovu which is occupied by humans today. Due to this ability, reports from Morogoro, Songea, Mtwara, Lindi, Manyara, Kilimanjaro, Mara and Arusha indicate an escalation of these because elephants are paying homage into their ancestral lands which are now occupied by villagers. Although it very early and difficult to establish the main reason of these events and one may look on the conservation activities but the presence of political stability in the country has a great contribution on the rise of population of these largest mammals in the country. Reports from southern Tanzania in Mtwara and Ruvuma show a big herd of more than 200 elephants are turning up and down farms and bushes in and around different villages because few months ago due to political instability in northern region of Mozambique is causing insecurity among elephants who do not recognize borders, to serve their lives they migrated from Cabo Delgado Province to Mtwara and Ruvuma in Tanzania. Cabo Delgado province is where Niassa game reserve is found on the border with Tanzania, scientific researchers from different parts of the world including Africa show civil wars among people affect the wellbeing of animals in the wild. Zoologists say the increase for access to automatic weapons and suspension of anti-poaching patrols were leading causes of wildlife population collapse, while installation of military bases within core conservation areas, overhunting of large-bodied mammals such as elephants. Covering about 82,625 square kilometers, Cabo Delgado province is passing through challenging moment filled with insecurity due to presence rebels who launch attacks and committed mass beheadings which caused many civilians who have been displaced by the fighting. Reports show on March 24, 2021, the militants seized Palma a town on the border with Tanzania where they murdered dozens of civilians and displacing more than 35,000 of the town’s 75,000 residents. Different reports indicate Mozambique has an estimated population of 10,800 elephants but just like others, elephants in the country are classified as vulnerable on the list of the International Union of Conservation of Nature, this is the third of seven levels of risk marked by IUCN where the seventh level is extinction. According to different sources most of these 10, 800 elephants dwell in Niassa game reserve which is witnessing the decline due to rise of the poaching activities. Experts say elephants has been an icon of African wildlife for many years and to see them in their natural habitat is often a primary reason for tourist to different national parks in Africa, however the African elephant is facing different challenging and this shows there are various factors involved in the decline of African elephants, such as loss of habitat and conflict with humans, however the overwhelming reason for the fall in population levels is poaching. With its troubled history of conflict, Mozambique has lost more than half of its wildlife since 1975 although the country has a large elephant range, encompassing approximately 320,000 square kilometers which is about 40 per cent of the total area of the country, different studies show Mozambique experienced a loss of 34 per cent of its elephant population, which translates to around 5600 elephants and the Niassa ecosystem has been hit particularly hard by elephant poaching activities. Niassa game reserve covers over 42,000 square kilometers, it is the largest protected area in the country, the animal’s sanctuary is an ecological protected area that spans boundaries of more than one country or sub-national entity where in Tanzania there is Lukwati which covers about 3,146 square kilometers and Lukwikalumesule with about 440 square kilometers but on the interior side there is Liparamba game reserve with about 570 square kilometers and increase the presence of elephants on the border between Tanzania and Mozambique. Meanwhile different fossils records indicate that between 61.1 and 57.8 million years ago it was the time when the first generation of elephants evolved on the Earth, then 56 million years ago a second generation evolved which lived by eating ancient foliage’s from shrubs and bushes with palm trees of sub-tropical and deciduous forest which started to grow do to the disappearance of grazing dinosaurs. History continue to show the first true elephant evolved between 23 and 5 million years ago when the global temperature rushed up and resulted into a rapid disappearance of forests and the spread of grasslands and savannah in different parts of the world including Africa where the African bush elephant is found today. Paleontologists say that was the time when Africa tectonic plate came into contact with Eurasia plate in a big collision which resulted into the formation of Mediterranean Sea, the crash enabled the evolution of two species of elephant, the Asian elephant and the African elephant which further divided into two subspecies the African forest Elephant which dwells in central, west and north Africa and African bush elephant which is found in east and south Africa. While weighing between 5,000 and 8,000 kilograms, the African bush elephant is the largest land animal on Earth because from 66 million years ago when the dinosaurs were pushed into extinct they started to thrive and conquer the whole continent until 1800s when another mammal which is powered by smartest brain started to kill them for pleasure and body parts. Size against smart brain have brought these two mammals into physical fights which have been witnessed in different parts of the country, reports of conflicts between humans and herds of elephants of different size, most affected areas were Wenje village on the border with Mozambique which was invaded by more than 20 elephants. All these are happening in different parts of the country because after the government has managed to control poaching activities in different game reserves which resulted into the rise of population of these mammals, but security in national parks has attracted elephants from neighboring countries which share ecosystems with national parks such as Mount Kilimanjaro national park, Serengeti national park, Katavi national park, Moyowosi game reserve and Selous game reserve. As the population of these mammals rises some herds and individual are forced to look for new grazing grounds, by going out from protected areas elephant come face to face with it only enemy in the world. This happens because an elephant is equipped with a strong tongue weighs 12 kilograms which enable an adult to consume about 250 kilograms of food each day, not only that, with a strong heart weighing 22 kilograms which use a powerful mechanism which pumps about 450 litres of blood to different organs and propel the colossal mammal of the savannah to run at maximum speed of 40 kilometers per hour. With ability of travelling between 10 and 20 kilometers a day, on their side zoologists say elephants live in female controlled herds made by about 10 related individuals which need to walk between 90 and 180 kilometers a day in search of enough supply of food and water. During dry season these largest land animals may walk more than 300 kilometers that why big herds are not available in smaller national parks such as Arusha which cover 328 square kilometers. On the other side, scientists say female elephants are the one who control the group and their successes are measured by their follows by counting the number of offspring they have managed to rise. A female leader guides and lives with her assistants who may be its sisters, aunts, cousins and nieces with their calves to good pasture from one season to another. To justify its role, the matriarch leader will also be ready to wage war against intruders and other enemies of her family, these may include humans who live in different areas around national park and game reserves in Tanzania. Reports from the northern part of Tanzania on the border with Kenya show the rise of conflicts between humans and elephants after herds of elephants from Tsavo national park decided to migrate from Kenya to resources rich ecosystem around Mkomazi national park in Tanzania.. rstanslaus@yahoo.com
