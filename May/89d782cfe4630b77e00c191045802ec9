ONLY students with the prerequisite qualifications will be admitted into various training institutions to pursue their preferred courses, the House of Representatives heard. Education and Training Minister, Simai Mohamed Said responding to a question by Mtambwe Representative Habib Ali Mohamed, dismissed as unfounded claims that the government through the National Council of Technical Education (NACTE) had barred admission of students who wrote their form four national examinations last year. He said all students with the basic qualifications can apply and join the training institutions to pursue their preferred courses. He said students normally get admission subject to their applications, which they can submit twice yearly—March and September. “So, for students who completed their form four education last year and submitted their applications last March, they have started joining various colleges...it’s just a matter of procedures and nobody has been denied the right to pursue their educational dreams,” Minister Simai said. He said there are rules that govern admission to higher learning institutions and students should first acquire the basic qualifications by passing their subjects, maintaining that admission without the prerequisite qualification will amount to violation of the existing regulations.
