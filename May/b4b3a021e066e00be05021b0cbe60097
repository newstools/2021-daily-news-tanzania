MARINE Services Company Limited (MSCL) has signed a 8.3bn/- contract with the Southern Korean –based M/S Ktmi Company Limited for renovation of the Motor Tanker (MT) Sangara in Lake Tanganyika. MSCL Board of Directors Chairperson, Prof Zacharia Mganilwa said MT Sangara is among the three ships whose renovation budget has been set aside in this financial year. “We have a total of nine projects in this fiscal year. Four projects involve construction of new ships and three projects will be for rehabilitation of ships including MT Sangara whose renovation duration is 12 months,” he said. He added that M/S Ktmi Company won the tender based on its experience and other criteria. He said the company also repaired the New MV Victoria Hapa Kazi Tu and MV Butiama in recent years. MT Sangara was built in 1981 in the Kigoma region by M/S Fulton Marine NV Belgium Ship Corporation, with a capacity to carry 410,000 liters of fuel, which are equivalent to 350 tonnes. The tanker ship was grounded in October 2020 due to failure of some parts including pumps, starboard and port side engines. TM Sangara operates from Kigoma Port to Burundi’s Capital (Bujumbura), Uvira and Kalemie towns of the DRC Congo. MSCL Acting Chief Executive Officer, Mr Philemon Bangambilana said the rehabilitation will help to revive the economy through boosting various economic activities in the area. According to him, at least 50 direct employment will be created. He said the project will involve local experts, plus a good number of indirect employments to various people, including food vendors. M/S Ktmi Company Secretary, Ms Asia Mohamed, commented that following her company’s long experience in the field, the project will be completed in the targeted time frame.
