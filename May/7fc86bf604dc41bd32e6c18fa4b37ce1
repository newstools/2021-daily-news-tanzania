CHIEF of Defense Forces (CDF), General Venance Mabeyo urged Tanzanians in South Africa on Saturday to spearhead the country’s foreign economic policy in line with President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s vision to enhance international diplomacy. General Mabeyo is in Pretoria, South Africa. He said shortly after a brief chart with Tanzania’s Ambassador in South Africa, Gaudence Milanzi, that the president needs to be supported as she pursues options to strengthen relationship between Tanzania and other countries. “President Samia aims to promote domestic and foreign development by implementing the Foreign Policy of the United Republic of Tanzania,” he noted during their conversation following a ceremony the two attend to bid farewell to South African’s Chief of Defence, General SZ Shiki. General Mabeyo’s presence at the farewell ceremony in South Africa is among the customs that have been set by the member states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) with the aim of strengthening cooperation, especially in the field of Defence Diplomacy and Peace in the SADC region.
