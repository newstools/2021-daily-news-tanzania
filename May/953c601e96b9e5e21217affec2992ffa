The UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet has warned both the Israeli Defence Force and Palestinian armed groups that air strikes and rocket attacks on densely populated civilian areas - as well as the use of live ammunition by Israeli security forces against protesters - may amount to war crimes, according to BBC. In a statement issued in Geneva, Bachelet called for an independent probe into all allegations of violations of international law, and appealed for a de-escalation of the violence. "Over the past 10 days, the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel has deteriorated at an alarming rate," she said. "The situation in Sheikh Jarrah in occupied East Jerusalem, triggered by threats of forced evictions of Palestinian families; the heavy presence of Israeli Security Forces and violence around the al Aqsa mosque during Ramadan; the severe escalation of attacks from and on Gaza; and the shocking incitement to racial hatred and violence in Israel have all led to vicious attacks and mounting casualties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Israel," added Bachelet. She appealed directly to the Israeli government to take steps to stop violence between Israeli settlers and Israeli Palestinians in the towns of Lod, Haifa, Jaffa and Ramle.
