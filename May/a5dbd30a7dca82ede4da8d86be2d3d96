THE Tanzania Swimming Association (TCA) will send two swimmers to South Africa in their bid to qualify for the Olympic Games to be held in July in Japan. The qualifying series will be held on May 7 and 8 in Stellenbosch Town. Thanks to Greatlakes Freight and Transport Company Limited that has sponsored the participation of Collins Saliboko and Hilal Hilal to the event. The Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo, Japan, from July 8 to August 23, this year. The firm’s General Manager Fahmy Ahmed said they have decided to support the swimmers as their part of involvement in the Corporate and Social Responsibilities (CSR) as well as developing the game in the country. Ahmed said the support is also aimed at inspiring young and talented swimmers’ involvement in the game. “We have many swimmers in the country who we believe can promote the country abroad through their talents. However, many talented swimmers are failing to do so because of lacking support, particularly sponsorship, from society. Many companies prefer sponsoring football and boxing for the reasons best known to themselves and forget other sporting event for their dormancy. He said they have decided to support the game of swimming in order to raise talents that, they believe, will promote the country by featuring in the international competitions. “This support shows how private companies can support different sporting events for them not to largely depending on government support,” he said. On her part, TSA Vice Chairperson Asmah Hilal thanked the company for its big support for the swimmers to get prepared for the games’ qualifying series. Asmah also thanked the Tanzania Olympic Committee (TOC) and Just Fit sports gear shop for supporting the swimmers. The swimmers are now in South Africa with their coach, Alex Mwaipasi.
