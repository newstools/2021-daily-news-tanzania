THE government has dismissed as baseless claims that Zanzibar City Council is abusing the Urban Municipal’s assets, including vehicles. Minister of State, President’s Office, Regional Administration, Local Governments and Special Departments, Masoud Ali Mohamed told the House of Representatives Wednesday that the city council uses the municipal’s vehicles rarely and on special agreements in the execution of their daily activities. The minister said the city council prior to acquiring its offices was operating from the offices of the Urban Municipal Council. But, the city council is currently housed in the former land, water and energy building at Forodhani. Responding to Mfenesini Representative Machano Othman Said who demanded clarification on rumors that the city council was misusing the municipal assets, Mr Mohamed said the city council has two vehicles, office furniture and other fixture and fittings.
