The deputy minister was responding to a question from Ali Omar King (Jang’ombe- CCM) who wanted to know when the government would resolve the electricity price dispute used by Tanzanians living in Zanzibar to create equality for all Tanzanians. He told the House that during the year 2020/21, a team of experts from the relevant institutions met in various forums and conducted a detailed analysis of the criteria involved in setting the price to sell electricity to major customers, including ZECO. “Based on such analysis, it is recommended that the criteria be reviewed to bring relief to such customers, including ZECO,” the deputy minister said. According to the deputy minister, the proposals were presented to the Committee of Ministries dealing with Union affairs to work on the proposals and find a solution on the issue in question.
