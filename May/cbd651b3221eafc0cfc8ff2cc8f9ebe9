ACADEMICIANS in the country have been urged to engage in research and publishing articles that will give a way forward in resolving the unemployment problems. Speaking during the opening of research week recently, the Dar es Salaam University College of Education (DUCE) Principal Prof Stephen Maluka said researchers must be part of the solution to the problems that face the country and the world at large. “As we begin another weeklong event, let me urge researchers to think outside the box and come up with solutions which will help in addressing unemployment challenges both within and outside the country,” he said. He then called upon other higher learning institutions in the country to organize similar events in their respective premises so that they would help the government to resolve some problems. On his part, Temeke District Commissioner Godwin Gondwe, who graced the event, urged researchers to use their findings for bringing changes in the country. “Do not lock your findings in shelves, let people get them for mutual development of the country,” he noted.
