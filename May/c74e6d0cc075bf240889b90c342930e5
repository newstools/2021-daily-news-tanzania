THE Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Hassan Abbasi has called on all athletes in the country to build confidence whenever they represent the country in international competitions. He said that the local athletes need to perform well at their international assignments, adding that in doing so they would have promoted Tanzania abroad. The PS noted that all athletes should realise that they are important representatives of the country and that the Government has begun allocating funds to support their participation in various international competitions. He said this while speaking to boxing stakeholders in Dar es Salaam at a special ‘Iftar’ organized by PeakTime Media for boxers. “The government does not currently present only the national flags to athletes, but it also provide financial support and equipment to athletes so that they can represent the country in the international sports,” explained Dr Abbasi. He added that the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports is currently making reforms that would shift them from being the regulator of sports industry and policies to the level of promoting sporting events. “In our ministry, we have already started shifting the direction of just being policy makers, but also turning to be sports promoters,” he said. He further urged the athletes to be seriously committed and disciplined during their career for their maturity and prosperity. On his part, Suleiman Semunyu, who organised the ‘Iftar’ thanked the Government for overseeing the sports industry and being close to various sports stakeholders. The ‘Iftar’ was also organised in honor of Yassin Abdallah Ustadh; the former President of the Paid Boxing Federation in the country who passed away last year in September. Meanwhile; the government has put aside plans to support the sports and entertainment sector, which has been growing fast in the past few couple of years.
