José Mourinho is set to take over as manager of Roma next season, the Serie A club have announced. Almost a month ago, the Portuguese was sacked by Tottenham last month and is returning to Italy, where he had a successful spell with Internazionale, according to the UK’s The Guardian. Mourinho is going to fill a Paulo Fonseca’s gap who will leave the club at the end of season. “The club are delighted to announce an agreement has been reached with José Mourinho for him to become our new head coach ahead of the 2021-22 season,” the Guardian quoted the Serie A club’s statement. Mourinho was at Inter for two seasons from 2008-09, winning Serie A twice and the Champions League before departing for Real Madrid. Roma will be at home on Thursday to welcome Manchester United in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final, trailing 6-2. Roma’s president, Dan Friedkin, and vice-president, Ryan Friedkin was quoted as saying: “We are thrilled and delighted to welcome José Mourinho into the AS Roma family. A great champion who has won trophies at every level, José will provide tremendous leadership and experience to our ambitious project. “The appointment of José is a huge step in building a long-term and consistent winning culture throughout the club.”
