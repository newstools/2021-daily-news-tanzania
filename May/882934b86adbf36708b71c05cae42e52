CHAMA cha Mapinduzi CCM and Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa have called for stern measures against officers involved in the Luku ‘crisis’ which left residents across the country frustrated over the system failure. The system resumed early on Thursday, almost two days after it was officially reported as out of order. Energy Minister Dr Medard Kalemani, immediately suspended for 10-days Tanesco’s ICT Manager Lonus Feruzi and his assistants Idda Njau and Frank Mushi. But CCM and the Premier said serious actions must be taken on the offers whether they were indirectly or deliberately involved in the system failure. “10-days is insufficient,” the Prime Minister Majaliwa told the Board of Directors for the State owned utility firm, Tanesco. “They have to be suspended indefinitely pending investigation into the problem.” In Dodoma, CCM Secretary General Daniel Chongolo told reporters that people have suffered as a result of failed system. “Some people depend on the electricity to generate income… no light means they did not produce,” he said. The ruling party ordered the government to immediately take action against all officers involved. It also wanted the government to complete rural electrification works across all areas that have not been connected. The government, however, asked Tanesco to fix an emergency backup plan in an event of a similar crisis so as to lower people’s frustration as they attempt to seek such crucial services.
