MINISTER of State in the Vice President’s Office, (Union and Environment), Mr Selemani Jafo has issued a ten-day ultimatum to Kigoma Municipal Executive Director to register the project for the construction of modern abattoir so that it can be issued with environment impact assessment (EIA) certificate. While on second day of his tour of Kigoma region, Minister Jafo visited the municipal abattoir and discovered that the construction was being done without observing the environmental requirements because the project had no EIA certificate. “I want this project to be registered as early as possible because, besides being issued with the certificate, it is crucial to get expert opinion on important issues to be considered in conserving environment,” Mr Jafo stressed. He warned that if the municipal would fail to register the project, he shall suspend its construction. “Currently there is a system of registering these projects online and I can access them through my tablet... if I won’t see your project by May 25 this year, I will suspend the construction,” Mr Jafo stressed. He, however, called upon all investors across the country to register their projects so that they can qualify for EIA certificate which outline the best way to minimize environmental impacts while implementing the projects. Meanwhile, Minister Jafo said that the sixth phase government was committed to ensuring that it encourages investors to invest in production of renewable energy which is environmentally friendly. The minister made the remark after visiting the solar energy project which impressed him because it is environmentally friendly. The project is currently generating 1 Megawatt and the production is expected to increase to 4.8 megawatts by 2025. He said that, the electricity generated from Kigoma min -grid has huge benefits to the environment because it was reducing the use of oil generated electricity which is very expensive .
