Tanzanian tycoon Rostam Aziz said investment in Tanzania and Kenya has not been the same, but possible in an individual country, hence, this should be reviewed to enhance ties between the two countries. Rostam made the remark today (May 5, 2021) at Tanzania-Kenya business forum held in Nairobi, Kenya and attended by President Samia Suluhu Hassan and her Kenyan counterpart, Uhuru Kenyatta. He said it is easy for a Kenyan to invest in Tanzania, but complicated for a Tanzanian to do the same in Kenya, adding: “There are 530 Kenyan companies that have invested more than 1.7 billion US dollar in Tanzania, but only 30 Tanzanian companies have successfully invested in Kenya with an investment of only 50 million US dollar.” In 2017, he explained, hewent to Kenya and held talks with President Kenyatta who invited him to invest in the country, but until now the issue has not worked out. “President Kenyatta asked me to come invest in Kenya and asked me what I would like to invest in, I told him I saw an opportunity in the gas industry…it is three years now and I still haven't received any answers about the investment, I planned for investment valued at 130 million US dollar. “If we do not build good investment relations between Tanzania and Kenya, then the existing relationship will not last, I would like to emphasize that equality is needed for both parties so that we can make the economy grow between the two countries,” he added.
