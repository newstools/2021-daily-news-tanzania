ZANZIBAR has never received any East African Community (EAC) funded development project since the community was reestablished in 1999, the House of Representatives has heard. Minister of State in the Second Vice-President’s Office, Policy and House of Representatives Coordination, Dr Khalid Salum Mohamed told the house that the revolutionary government had presented eight projects for funding but only four sailed through. Answering a question by Mfenesini Representative Machano Othman Said who sought to know the EAC-funded projects in the islands so far, Dr Khalid said procedurally, the community doesn’t finance development projects in member states. He clarified that during their February 22, 2018 retreat meeting in Kampala, Uganda, the EAC member states approved priority and flagship projects to speed up execution of infrastructure projects in member states. Dr Khalid said Abeid Amani Karume International Airport’s (AAKIA) terminal three, Pemba Airport, Maruhubi port, dry dock and roll-on-roll-off (RoRo) between Zanzibar, Dar es Salaam, Pemba, Tanga and Mombasa ports were approved for Zanzibar but have never received funding. The minister said the government opted for alternative sources of funding to implement the terminal three, Pemba airport and Maruhubi port projects, which are on various stages of execution.
