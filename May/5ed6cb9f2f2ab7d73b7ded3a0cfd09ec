THE national Beach Soccer team is expected to jet off early next week for Dakar, Senegal, to compete in the 2021 Beach Soccer Africa Cup of Nations (BSAFCON) finals. The country’s envoys are packed in group A of the contest together with the hosts Senegal, DR Congo and Uganda respectively in a seemingly difficult category. According to the available fixture, Tanzania will kick off the campaign by taking on Uganda before facing DR Congo and later entertaining Senegal. Speaking recently, the team’s Head Coach Boniface Pawasa said so far, everything is well within his squad and players are responding well to training programmes. “We are looking ahead to the competition and I’m sure that with the level of preparations we have had, our mission in Senegal will be amicably accomplished,” he said. He added that the reason they opted to pitch a camp in Zanzibar was to adapt to the atmosphere before heading to the battlefield. He then requested for total support from all Tanzanians for them to shine in Senegal and be able to bring back silverware for the first time. “We are going there to represent the country that is why we need full backing from our people and concerned stakeholders in order to perform well in all our matches,” he said. On Thursday, the team visited former President Ali Hassan Mwinyi at his residence in Zanzibar where they had good moments to speak and get some wise words from him. Speaking on behalf of his teammates, the team’s skipper Roland Msojo said he believes that this time around, they will achieve a lot. “This will be our second time to compete in BSAFCON finals and basing on the preparations we have had, I see us doing well,” he said.
