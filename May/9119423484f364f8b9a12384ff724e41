The first vehicle award in the Bonge Campaign run by NMB bank was on Wednesday handed over to Ms Hadija Iddi a resident of Chamwino in Dodoma Region. Ms Hadija becomes the first winner in the grand prizes offered by the financial institution in the campaign that started in February this year. Handing over the 25m/- award, the NMB Acting Chief Internal Audit Officer, Mr Benedicto Baragomwa said the campaign was on-going across the country and various prizes will continue to be won. Mr Baragomwa said NMB was giving away prizes to customers who continue to open their accounts and that the overall winner will grab a luxury car. The car to be offered is a Toyota Fortuner worth 169m/-which is zero kilometres. "Today we are handing over to Ms Hadija the key to the winner, but we have many prizes for our customers who save from 100,000/- in their NMB accounts," added Mr Baragomwa. Speaking immediately after her car was handed over, Hadija said, â€œThe vehicle will help me in my income-generating activities. And I would like to advise my fellow Tanzanians to invest in the bank as it has significant benefits. In a related development, NMB Central Region Manager Nsolo Mulozi led another draw for the winners where various people earned money after winning in different areas. The draw took place at the bank's Chamwino Ikulu Branch under the supervision of officials from the gaming board.
