Minister for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, has today suspended for ten days Tanesco Telecommunications and Business Services Manager Lonus Feruzi along with two officials to give explanations following a problem electricity token purchasing service. The two officials who also suspended were named as Frank Mushi na Idda Njau. “If their information provided will not be enough, the employees should be fired ,” Dr Kalemani told reporters in Dar es Salaam. For about three days, Tanesco customers have been unable to buy tokens electronically, forcing the corporation to direct its customers to purchase electricity at its regional and district offices in various parts of the country. Despite the directions of where to buy power, still some clients were unable to access the tokens at the stations where they were directed. The mess has forced the Deputy Minister for Energy Stephen Byabato to   apologize to the public in Parliament, saying Tanesco technicians are working on it and that by evening today the problem will be solved. He made statement while responding to a question from a lawmaker, Cosato Chumi (Mafinga Urban-CCM), who sought to know the government's action following the problem that is depriving Tanesco revenue and hampering economic activities of the people.
