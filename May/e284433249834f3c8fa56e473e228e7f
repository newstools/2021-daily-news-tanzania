SPEAKER of the House of Representatives, Zubeir Ali Maulid has called upon the banks operating in Zanzibar to widen their scope of credit facility, including giving special priority to special groups when issuing loans. Speaker Maulid made the call over the weekend when he presided over an Iftar event organized by Equity Bank in Zanzibar, insisting that maintaining cordial relations with customers was one of the tenets of winning the market. He implored banks to give special priority to special groups, especially women and youth to support their business. According to Speaker Maulid, being closer to the public makes customers to feel part of the financial institutions, a situation that encourages them to be easily attracted and apply for loans. “Be closer to people, it is the way of attracting customers who wish to apply for loans for their business,” Mr Maulid said. The speaker commended Equity Bank for the Iftar, urging it to strengthen good relations. The Bank’s senior officers from both Zanzibar and Mainland Tanzania thanked participants for turning-up for the Iftar.
