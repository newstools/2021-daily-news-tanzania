MINISTER for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, has directed Tanesco to install two transformers, with 4.5MW to newly introduced Busolwa Mine in Misungwi District by the end of this month. He said the directive was part of the government’s plan to ensure all mining sites were supplied with power. He issued the directive mid-this week during his tour of the mine, directing Tanesco regional manager Felix Olang to meet the deadline to help reduce mining operational costs. “I have been told that mine operators spend about 1.8bn/- per month on purchasing fuel to run their generators. The government does whatever is within its reach to create a conducive investment environment everywhere. Availability of reliable and affordable power services is part of that,” said Dr Kalemani. The minister noted further that in 2019 the government had supplied 82 small-scale mining sites with electricity, adding that between 2015 and 2020 at least 138 mines were connected to power. “I insist that both small and large-scale mines wil be reached as the government values the mining sector’s contribution to country’s economy. We should, therefore, help them reduce unnecessary operational costs. We are happy that almost all raw materials are locally-produced to facilitate electrification,” stressed the minister. He also directed Tanesco to know all mines in need of power services and serve them accordingly. Managing Director of Busolwa Mine Baraka Ezekiel said mining operations were set to take off next month, with at least 300 direct employment opportunities created. He admitted to have been spending a lot of money on generators’ fuel (1.8bn/-) in ongoing mining preparations. “We are thankful that the government cares its investors. The two transformers will at a large extent smoothen our operations here. Full operations will take off this month,” said the director.
