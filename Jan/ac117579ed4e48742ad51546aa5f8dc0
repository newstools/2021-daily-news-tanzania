Uganda's main opposition presidential candidate Bobi Wine says his life is being threatened following Thursday's election which saw Yoweri Museveni win a sixth elected term. The singer-turned-politician told the BBC that he rejected the results "with the contempt they deserve". He alleged there had been a lot of irregularities but Mr Museveni called it Uganda's fairest ever vote. Campaigning had been marred by violence in which dozens of people died. Just ahead of voting day the government shut down the internet, a move condemned by election monitors. They said confidence in the count had been damaged by the days-long cut. A government minister told the BBC on Saturday evening that the internet service would be restored "very soon". According to the Uganda Electoral Commission Yoweri Museveni won presidential election by 5.85 million votes while Bobi Wine got 3.48 million.
