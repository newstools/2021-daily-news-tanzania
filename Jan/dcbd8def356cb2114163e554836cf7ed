TANZANIANS, including religious leaders, have been asked to collaborate with the government to fight against evils reported in the country, especially violence against children and women. Speaking recently to reporters on such evils in Moshi, Kilimanjaro Region, Rev Pastor Ron Swai of the Kilimanjaro Revival Temple (KRT) Church said: "We have started the New Year 2021 and the challenge we have ahead of us is to ensure we help the government to fight against the evils reported in the country, including people committing suicide and others who kill their spouses and children due to different reasons, including various forms of abuse," he said. Rev Swai noted that, this year the church had organised various seminars and a 21-day-special prayer service to pray for the nation. "The aim of our programme is to preach and organise prayer services in all zones in the country. It is only through cooperation that we can end those evils," he said, adding that a prayer service in that line was held in Pasua Ward in Moshi Municipal Council in Kilimanjaro Region. On international dialogue on a new variant of Covid-19 caused by coronavirus, Rev Swai urged Tanzanians not to panic, instead they should continue taking precautions as directed by health experts. "We join the government in its repeated statements meant to raise public awareness so that all Tanzanians take necessary steps as directed by health experts concerning this disease. My advice to my fellow Tanzanians is for them to follow all instructions given by health experts," he said.
