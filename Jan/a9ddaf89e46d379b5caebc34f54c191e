President Donald Trump has been allowed to tweet again after being locked out of his account for 12 hours. Before his account was locked, he had posted several messages on Wednesday in which he called the people who stormed Capitol Hill “patriots”. He also reiterated false claims of voter fraud. Trump has been warned by the social media site that he will be banned “permanently” if he breaches the platform’s rules again. So far, he's playing it safe - only tweeting a video where he takes a more conciliatory tone and pledges to facilitate a peaceful transition of power. Other social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and popular gaming platform Twitch have been stricter. Twitch has placed an indefinite ban on Mr Trump’s channel while Facebook has suspended the president from its site and Instagram for the next two weeks. The total number of deaths connected to Wednesday's riot has reached five. Aside from the US Capitol police officer whose death we reported on earlier, the remaining four were Trump supporters attending the march.
