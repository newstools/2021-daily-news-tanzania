OVER 1,000 students at Sirari Primary School are forced to relieve themselves in bushes due to lack of toilets, a situation that could lead to epidemics and endanger their lives. Parents and well-wishers from Sirari Ward decided at a gathering recently that the school requires 840,000/- to build toilets and address the situation. The chairman of the school committee, Samwel Togo, said some parents had misinterpreted the government’s decision of free education and hence, failed to fulfill their responsibility to participate in development activities, including construction of school infrastructures. He said apart from the deterioration of the toilet facilities, the school is facing a shortage of four classrooms to accommodate the increase enrollments of pupils, forcing more than 60 to share a classroom. A Sirari Primary School former pupils’ coordinator Nchagwa Magasi who contributed 30 bags of cement worth 600,000/- during the gathering said fellow ex-pupils should also assist in such initiative. He said apart from donating building materials they should also have funds to cater for less privileged children, who perform well in exams to realise their dreams. He said they should also concentrate on fighting traditional cultures especially Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) that is abusing the rights of the girl-child. In a related development, the school’s head Kennedy Muniko said that due to the recent holiday, more girl students will not report to school as a result of going for FGM practices. He, hence, urged village leaders to make sure they look for the absentees and take their parents to task. He said it is illegal for a girl to drop out of school to concentrate on FGM or get married, just because a parent wants immediate dowry.
