RUKWA Regional Commissioner, Mr Joachim Wangabo has encouraged citizens to increase fish consumption as efforts towards reducing stunted growth rate in children. The RC explained that although the region is realising bumper surplus of food in every season, consumption of one type of food mainly rich in starchy was still a challenge in the area. Equally most of citizens residing along Lake Tanganyika and the Lake Rukwa shores do not consume large amount of fish. “The Rukwa Region is blessed with several water bodies, for instance during the period of 2018/19 and 2019/20 about 2,444.3 tonnes of fish were harvested,” he pointed out. The RC made such remarks recently while meeting fishermen, stakeholders and the general public in his bid to encourage people to increase fish consumption and address stunted growth in children aged below five years old due to severe malnutrition. Demographic Heath Survey and Malaria Indicator of 2015/16 show that Rukwa Region has 56.3 per cent of stunted children. But the rate has dropped to 8.4 per cent as per Tanzania National Nutrition Survey (TNS- 2018) which indicates that the region has 47.9 per cent of stunted children below the age of five years old. "Despite the TNS survey yet the rate of stunting in children in the region is still high among children aged below five years. “Concerted efforts are still needed to save the children including encouraging people to eat large amounts of fish, because the nutritional benefits of fish are unique" added  Mr Wangabo. Available statistics from the Ministry of Fishery 2019/20 indicates that one Tanzanian consumes between seven or eight kilogrammes of fish per year. While the UN--Food and Agriculture Organisations (FAO) recommends that one person should eat 20kgs of fish annually. Medical literature recounts that Omega 3 protein fats from fatty fish has various nutritional benefits for human body and brain development.
