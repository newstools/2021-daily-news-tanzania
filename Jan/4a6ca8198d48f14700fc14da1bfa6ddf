WATER Minister, Jumaa Aweso has ordered immediate suspension of two Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (RUWASA) managers in Mara region. Those suspend are Mara Regional RUWASA Manager, Eng Sadick Chakka, and Tarime District RUWASA Manager, Eng Marwa Muraza. The minister took the decision at Nyakonga Ward in Tarime Rural on Tuesday after inspecting Magoma water project implementation, terming it poorly implemented despite several years it stalled. “It is time for workers, who cannot perform to quit at this multimillion shillings project. I am not ready to spend fuel all the way from Dodoma to come and see water projects claimed to be completed by over 90 per cent and no water to the people. My pleasure is to see citizens getting water everywhere and that is why we established RUWASA,” said the Minister. He said Mara region especially Tarime and Rorya district have such projects, which the government won’t stomach. Thus, Mr Aweso directed Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Water, Eng Anthony Sanga to suspend the two RUWASA managers for failing to supervise the implementation of the water projects. Equally, he directed the PS to form a team that will investigate all questionable water projects being supervised by RUWASA in the Lake Zone region. The minister wondered why the regional RUWASA bank account has enough money for the projects, yet they are not being implemented because they entertain lazy officers. Minister Aweso is in Mara region for a working tour and urged water experts to use their expertise to improve water services to the residents. “We (water experts) should use our expertise to enable citizens get water service. The fifth phase government has pumped millions of shillings to improve water service in the Lake Zone and plans are also underway to draw water from Lake Victoria in order to end water shortage in some areas and we must work towards this goal,”
