SEVEN Councilors from Kalambo District Council, Rukwa Region, have embarked on building secondary schools in areas lacking them and setting next year as their deadline. The councilors further said the work is in line with their pledge to the electorates, last year when they were looking for votes. The latest official statistics show that Kalambo District Council has seven Wards and all do not have any secondary school forcing students to walk to other districts for the service. The seven wards in are listed as Matai, Lyowa, Samazi, Mkali, Manamba, Samazi and Sundu. The seven councilors were led by Kalambo District Council, Mr Daud Sichone, without going into details said: “We are giving assurance here at Matai Secondary School, where Rukwa Region Commissioner (RC) Mr Joachim Wangabo is leading the public that we shall construct nine classrooms. He further the councilors will jointly work hard with other stakeholders, to ensure the schools are built and ready to accommodate Form One students by next year. “We are determined and will make sure challenges of shortages of schools and their classrooms and furniture become history…we will see any student failing to join Form One by next year, because there are no classrooms,” he added. Elaborating, he briefed the RC that out of seven councilors, five he named as Lyowa, Mkali, Samazi, Sundu and Mnamba have mobilized the public and began digging trenches in their respective wards. On his part, Matai Ward Councilor, Mr Vitus Tenganamba commended citizens from the area who turned out in large numbers to participate in on construction of nine classrooms at Matai Secondary School.
