THE GOVERNMENT is in the process to legalise all unofficial ports as a strategy to improve marine transport. The move, according to Tanzania Shipping Agencies Corporation (TASAC), Member of the Board of Directors, Captain Mussa Mandia, will subsequently boost government’s revenue. Speaking after visiting Kilwa Masoko Port, Capt. Mandia said preliminary assessments focusing on how the plan would be executed in order to increase efficiency. "There is a big challenge in the smuggling business, marine vessels that do not meet the safety requirements but there have also been illegal fishing…but all these are being supported by the presence of unrecognized ports. “We are working with the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) along with regional governments throughout Tanzania to ensure that the assessment is completed so that some unknown ports can be formalized to save government revenue and also the people to benefit from the outcomes such as social services as well as improve there working environment. "If the port is formalized, it will be easy to manage safety of those who use marine vessels," he said. Meanwhile, TASAC’s Acting Vessel Registration Manager, Engineer Alfred Waryana said it was time for the unknown ports and unofficial vessels to be formalized as he added: "We believe we have a big challenge in the regulation of vessels. Security is starting at the port, but we see many places operating illegally as ports.” At the Kilwa Kivinjeni dock, one of the fishermen identified himself as Juma Ngondaye, said that the government has not benefited from the pier due to the many smuggling activities taking place. "We are aware of the great achievements of President John Pombe Magufuli, we know he knows the importance of the port here in Kilwa, I believe if better systems are placed, all will be well in terms of economic growth.”
