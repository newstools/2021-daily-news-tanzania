FIRST Vice-President Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad on Saturday landed on Pemba Island for a short tour and called for unity, peace and honesty in service delivery. He said all leaders, including executives at all levels, must work honestly in serving people and that the current Government of National Unity (GNU) need to see unity among citizens after burying political hatred. "If all leaders at all levels serve people without discrimination, complaints will be minimised to a considerable extent," he said at a meeting with special groups at Uweleni Secondary School in Pemba. He was speaking with people with disabilities and women and it was his first visit to Pemba as First Vice-President since his appointment by President Hussein Ali Mwinyi on December 7, 2020. He said the government wanted to see that there was no any discrimination in service delivery, urging all executives at district, regional and central government levels to serve people equally. "You have your code of conduct, ethics, regulations and the Constitution. Observe these so that you remain honest. We have been moving on well since the 8th phase government under President Mwinyi started its term. Let us maintain this collaboration," Maalim Seif said. He noted that without political reconciliation which ACT-Wazalendo accepted to work with Dr Mwinyi, achieving development goals would be difficult. "It was not easy to accept to bury our political differences, but here we are. Let bygone be bygone. I thank President Mwinyi for the decision," he said as he continued urging all people on Pemba and Unguja Islands to put aside the past. Mr Omar Talib one of the people he addressed on Saturday also expressed their hope in the GNU government, saying the country expected to move forward economically, socially and politically.
