Deputy Minister of Livestock and Fisheries, Pauline Gekul has given Ilala District Director, Msogela Palela seven days to pay the contractor who is building the Vingunguti abattoir 5bn/- so that he completes construction. The Minister gave the instruction during his tour of the area where he went to supervise the progress of the building in the area in Dar es salaam. Elaborating, Gekul said in recent days, animals are being slaughtered in a dirty environment, adding that this will affect consumers. In addition to that, Gekul said completion of the building should go hand in hand with the purchase of vehicles which will be used to carry and supply meat in Dar es Salaam butcheries instead of using motorcycles.
