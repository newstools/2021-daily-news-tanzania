THE implementation of Mtumba government city’s 51.2km road project at bitumen level has reached 56 per cent. This was said by Secretary of the National Committee for Coordinating the Government Plan to shift to Dodoma Meshack Bandawe while inspecting the progress of the road project in Dodoma. “Currently, they are dealing with the construction of the road in the government city, which is good progress and by July this year will be completed,” said Mr Bandawe. He said the work involved the construction of a two-lane road of 22.4km and a one-way road of 28.8km, with the construction of the construction of infrastructures of water, electricity, gas, telecommunications, fire and rescue, supermarkets as well as train services. Meanwhile, he said the construction of the ministry’s buildings phase II would begin after authorisation and completion of other procedures. In June 2020, President John Magufuli laid the foundation stone for the construction of the road in the government city in Dodoma. The construction of the road, which commenced on February 01, 2020, is expected to be completed on July 31, 2021, at 89.232bn/- where 11.2km will be four lanes and 28.8km will be two lanes. Shifting the government capital from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma was part of President Magufuli’s pledges during the 2015 presidential campaign. Dodoma was declared the capital city of Tanzania in 1974. Despite that, Dar es Salaam remained the central administrative and the most prominent city in the country. Following the 2017 move to Dodoma by the country’s Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, followed by several ministries and the Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan, the entire Tanzanian government is now in the new capital.
