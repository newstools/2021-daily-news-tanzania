THE government is set to enact a new law that will require boats and canoes to carry life jackets for each person onboard. Those who will infringe it including fishermen and passengers will be punished accordingly. Addressing an education programme on marine safety to operators and vessel owners in Geita on Saturday, Tanzania Shipping Agency (TASAC), Director General, Emmanuel Ndomba was optimistic that drowning deaths among boaters will be reduced to zero if legislators nod on the proposed bill to become the law. Over the past two years, water transportation has tremendously improved and this is said to be after the government’s bold decision to establish Tanzania Shipping Agencies Corporation (Tasac) under Section 4 of the Tanzania Shipping Agencies Act No 14 of 2017, but special tasks begun in February 2018. Recently, according to Mr  Ndomba, TASAC had successfully improved the safety of water transportation by promoting the security of marine vessels.
