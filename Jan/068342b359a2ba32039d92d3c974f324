MINISTER for Tourism and Heritage Lela Muhammed Mussa has formed a six-member committee to probe the collapse of a large section of the historical Beit-al-Ajab building. The building, which is one of the famous tourist attractions and the Isles icon, collapsed last Friday, killing two people and injuring four others. President Hussein Ali Mwinyi promised to form the committee to investigate the cause of the collapse. According to the minister, the committee to be chaired by Ms Fatma Issa Kara, will be provided with terms of reference as she asked residents to cooperate with committee members. Other members of the committee are Mr Ali Ali Hassan (secretary), Mr Abdulhamid Mohd Ali Mhoma, Mr Ali Said Bakari, Mr Salum Suleiman Ali and Mr Mwalim Ali Mwalimu. “We ask the committee to find out what exactly happened and advise us accordingly,” Ms Mussa said, adding that the government was committed to restoring the collapsed section of Stone Town so that it remained a tourist centre. Residents and stakeholders say many buildings in Zanzibar are in bad condition and are likely to collapse due to lack of maintenance. Buildings’ collapse is also linked to lack of funds, poor management and violation of the master plan during construction, negligence and the use of substandard construction materials.
