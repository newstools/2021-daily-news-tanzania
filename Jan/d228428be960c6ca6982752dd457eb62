A SECTION of entrepreneurs at Katoro Township in Geita Region have raised their concern over what they described as hiked tax rates imposed by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). Speaking during a joint meeting with TRA officials, Chairman of Katoro entrepreneurs, Charles Makanji said the high tax rates had negatively affected their businesses. “Due to hiked tax rates, some of the entrepreneurs have closed down their shops. Instead, they opted to open kiosks along pavements, where one could at least raise 25,000/- that will enable him/her to pay for the identity card (ID). We appeal for government intervention,” he said. Medard Gamaya, who owns a retail shop at Katoro explained that during 2016, he was listed to pay 150,000/- tax, which increased to 200,000/- the following year, while during 2018, the amount increased to 450,000/-. According to him, in 2019 he was tasked to pay 500,000/- while last year he was tasked to pay 4.6m/- tax. “This is quite disturbing because my capital is less than 10m/-,” he lamented. Geita Regional TRA Manager, Hashim Ngoda, who also attended the meeting, appealed to business people to properly keep their daily transaction to enable TRA officials to make correct tax rates.
