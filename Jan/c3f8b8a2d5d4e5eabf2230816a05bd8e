SIMBA have once again lifted the lid on Bernard Morrison saying he is gradually recovering from Malaria that is why he is currently not featured in games. This was said by the team’s caretaker coach Selemani Matola after guiding his side to a comfortable 2-0 win over Mtibwa Sugar at Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar over the weekend. The victory gave Simba a slot into the semifinals of the unfolding Mapinduzi Cup as they still enjoy 100 per cent run into the competition after registering two back to back successes. However, asked to comment on why Morrison is not being given a chance to play despite attending in person most of the games played by Simba, Matola said he is yet to be fully fit. “Morrison was suffering from Malaria and he is gradually getting better now. If we will reach as far as the finals of the competition, perhaps he will earn a chance to play,” he said. Giving his assessment of the game itself, Matola noted that it was tough as it was the repeat of last year’s Mapinduzi Cup finals of which Simba lost to Mtibwa Sugar 1-0. “The match was difficult but I am thankful to my players because what we tasked them to do prior to the match was executed well leading us to generate the positive results,” he said. Elaborating on some of the new players who were given playing time in Simba colours on the day, Matola said they were on trials such that after the competition, they will be thoroughly assessed to see if they can sign for the club. On his part, Mtibwa Sugar player Hamad Hilika said it was unfortunate that their game plan did not work out as they initially planned before the match. “Mistakes we made during the game were positively utilised by our opponents as such, we do not have other excuses apart from conceding the defeat,” he said. His counterpart for Simba Dilunga who had the best game on the day and contributed one goal narrated that their mission is to clinch the Mapinduzi Cup silverware.
