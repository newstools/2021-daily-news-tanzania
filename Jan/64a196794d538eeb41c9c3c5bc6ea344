HUNDREDS of believers flocked to Tanzania Missionaries Revival Church in Mara Region and participated in special prayers for the nation, calling on leaders at all levels in the country to be God-fearing. Presiding at special prayer service at the weekend, Bishop Jacob Lutubija said it was only God-given leaders, who would save the nation from disasters, including diseases and corruption. He said in recent days the world had been plagued by the deadly disease—Covid-19 and President John Magufuli instructed leaders of various denominations and the people to pray to God for protection. He said the move had saved the nation from the disaster that would have created panic and anxiety among Tanzanians. “Our President, Dr John Magufuli, has set an example by reminding us as a nation, the importance of believing in God to protect us against disasters, including the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. He explained that the world was experiencing an increase in the number of destructive events such as wars and growing fears due to the existence of various nations with non-God-fearing leaders. One of the church members, Ms Rebebeca Nyanjira, said they had made arrangements to organise a special prayer service every month in church to pray for the nation and recognise the importance of peacekeeping. "By participating in worship and praying for the nation, we find comfort and avoid evil deeds. In this way, we strengthen our faith in God and when we pray to him he grants us what we pray for, such as peace among ourselves and also in society around us,” she noted.
