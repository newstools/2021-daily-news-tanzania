President John Magufuli has extended a local contractor’s work for two years though, after his retirement according to the constitution, citing his excellent work, while in active duty. The decision was reached earlier by the Head of State, while addressing a gathering at Al Hassan Mwinyi Grounds after inaugurating the Lake Victoria Water Project in Tabora region on Saturday. He said that was his reward while also applauding the Contractors and Engineer, who completed the big water project that will supply the liquid in the region piped from Lake Victoria. Elaborating, Dr Magufuli said the project that is being sponsored by a loan from India is expected to serve 1.5/-million residents in a 1200 kilometer distance backed up with 29 tanks and 728 water fetching points. President Magufuli asked the residents to own and handle well the water project for their domestic use, adding: “I would not expect to see the treated clean and safe water also being used to water and bake bricks. Equally, I want to see leaders displaying tanks with no water for the residents…they should start providing water.”
