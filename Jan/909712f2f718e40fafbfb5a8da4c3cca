IT was all smiles for people with disabilities (PWDs) in Babati District, Manyara Region, after a donation of 31 wheelchairs, thanks to a nongovernmental organisation, Chemchem Safaris. Speaking during the handover of 21m/- wheelchairs to people with disabilities, Manyara Regional Commissioner (RC) Joseph Mkirikiti said the assistive devices would enhance mobility and the quality of life of people with difficulties in walking, especially those suffering from spinal cord injuries. Mr Mkirikiti further said wheelchair mobility would help wheelchair users study, work and engage in social activities and access services such as healthcare. “In addition to providing mobility, an appropriate wheelchair benefits the quality of life of users by reducing common problems such as pressure sores, progression of deformities and improve respiration and digestion,” explained the regional boss. The RC expressed gratitude to Chemchem Safaris for supporting PWDs, describing it as timely support. “I commend you for this generous gesture. It is my belief that this doesn’t mark the end of your support to such groups,” he added. For his part, Chemchem Director Nicolas Negri explained that the donation was part of 242 wheelchairs to be given to PWDs in the region. “Mindful that our core business is tourism, giving back to the community remains our priority,” said the official. According to CCBRT, there are 4.2 million Tanzanians living with disabilities and 3.2 per cent of Tanzanian homes have at least one member with a disability. People with disabilities are often among the poorest and most marginalised in society. The condition has a significant impact on health, employment and education.
