Accompanied by the first lady, Donald Trump is leaving the White House for the last time during his presidency.
Trump will not attend his successor's inauguration - only the fourth president not to do so. Joe Biden is to be sworn in as the 46th US president just before 17:00 GMT in Washington. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office alongside him - the first woman to hold that position. Some 25,000 troops will guard the inauguration ceremony after a deadly riot at the Capitol earlier this month.
