TCA Development had no match to Alaf Aces after losing by 28 runs in the weekly played TCA Seifee Cup 2020 held at Annadil Burhani ground in Dar es Salaam. The victors tossed to bat first to score 84/4 in the T10 match but TCA could not manage to make successful chase. They ended their inning at 65/5 as the day was tough for them. Raza Baloch and Raza Vakil scored 27 and 26 runs, respectively before they were stamped out. Sayan Vijay and Brijesh Hitesh had 18 and 17 for their TCA side. It was a blow for the losers as none of their batsmen were capable to make an immense contribution. The rest had not more than 5 runs each to deny a perfect chase for their side. Last weekend, Sklpsc beat Union Sports Club by four wickets at the same venue. The T10 tournament has been organised by Annadil Burhani Club as part of the festivities to mark the Birthday of their Spiritual Leader Dr Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin. Annadil Burhani Cricket ground is one of the oldest cricket ground that has severally hosted a number of domestic and international.
