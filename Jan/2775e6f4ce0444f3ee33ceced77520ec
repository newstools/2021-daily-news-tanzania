TANZANIA National Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) in Dodoma region has cited random bushfires as affecting their electricity supply and resulting in power outages in the region. However, Energy Minister Dr Medard Kalemani ordered the state-power utility to ensure no power interruption is seen, unless during emergencies and with notice. Inspecting the construction work at the Zuzu power station, the minister recently, said private and public institutions, which have not cleared their electric bills must be disconnected. Elaborating, Dr Kalemani further said: “Power disconnection has begun and let me caution all those who are trying to call me... I will not listen to you for any favour.” He issued a countrywide power disconnection order adding that over 180bn/- has not been cleared as unpaid bills in hands of the debtors, let alone over 3.6bn/- for ordinary customers. Tanesco’s Dodoma Region Manager Frank Chambua said the recently repeated power interruptions in several parts of the region was as a result of people setting on fire several transmission lines. Explaining, the Manager could not quantify the amount of energy lost in such incidences and losses incurred to replace them. “We urge people starting fire to count 10 steps away from any electric pole,” he said, adding that the fire burning grass does not discriminate. He said the company has been storing about 40 poles in a single day only for to be burnt by fire, adding: “This is a problem in improving electricity supply in the area and thorough public awareness is necessary to protect the electric infrastructures.” One of the most hit areas according to Tanesco is Mpwapwa electric line that in addition to the line receiving power from Zuzu Substation, its problem routinely affects the whole area. Mr Chambua suggested that an immediate extension as a substation be at Narco Kongwa to stabilise electric supply in towns receiving electricity through the Mpwapwa transmission line.
