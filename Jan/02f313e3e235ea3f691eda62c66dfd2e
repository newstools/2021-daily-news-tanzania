RORYA District Commissioner (DC) Simon Odunga has banned charcoal burning activities, saying the government will crack down on some parents who exploit young children in those activities. The leader issued the directive as the district launched a special environmental conservation strategy and encouraged the use of renewable energy and tree planting. He said in recent days, there have been reports from rural areas about the tendency of some unscrupulous parents of enslaving young school children in commercial activities, including charcoal burning. He instructed divisional and ward secretaries, including village leaders, to track them down and ensure all parents involved in child labour during the end-of-year holidays are prosecuted. “Currently, Rorya district is slowly turning into a desert, and the government is encouraging people to use renewable energy and avoid deforestation, which could lead to climate change,” he said. He instructed all ward agricultural officers to guide the people in their areas on how to make productive agriculture enriched with good food crops and environmentally friendly crops and avoid cutting down native trees. He urged all citizens who trade in forest products to seek for permit from forest offices and avoid smuggling such crops to neighbouring districts because it is against the law. “We urge all citizens in the district who are interested in trading forest products to follow the legal process, including obtaining a permit from the forestry office and avoiding environmental degradation,” he said.
