Arsenal moved into top 10 of the English Premier League as striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored two goals to hand over the Gunners a 3-0 win against Newcastle. According to BBC, Aubameyang, who had earlier hit the post from a tight angle in the first half, opened the scoring in the 50th minute when he fired past Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow. Arsenal doubled their lead as Emile Smith Rowe's pullback found Bukayo Saka and the England international side-footed the ball into the net. Aubameyang, 31, got his second and the Gunners' third after Cedric Soares, in his first league start of the season, got to the byline and set up the striker. The Gabon international scored 29 goals in all competitions last season, including 22 in the Premier League, but he had previously struggled for goals in 2020-21. This double took his league total to five for the campaign and boss Mikel Arteta was pleased to see Aubameyang return to form.
