MINISTER for Water Jumaa Aweso has congratulated Managing Director of Musoma Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Muwasa) CPA Joyce Msiru on improved service delivery. “Congratulations madam! You did a job in Moshi and you are doing a better job here in Musoma Municipal Council,” the minister told CPA Msiru on Thursday. Mr Aweso said the first woman MD to lead Muwasa had made greatest reforms to improve water services in Musoma Municipal Council. Earlier, CPA Msiru told the minister that Muwasa had increased its water network that covered 95 per cent of Musoma Municipal Council. According to CPA Msiru, the government has invested 47bn/- to improve water services in Musoma Municipal Council over the past five years. She said Muwasa had also metered all water users by 100 per cent and significantly reducing uncounted water in recent months. Equally, CPA Msiru said Muwasa’s revenue and customers had also increased sharply. However, she cited dishonest people who stole water and damaged water infrastructure, including pipes, 1.1bn/- debt that various public institutions owed Muwasa as some of the challenges they were facing. Mr Aweso urged Muwasa to have no mercy on vandalism and water thefts. “You are able to end this challenge (vandalism and water theft). Take action against all people who steal water and damage water infrastructure,” Mr Aweso directed. He winded up his three-day tour of Mara Region on Thursday. During his tour, Mr Aweso directed the immediate suspension of three managers of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Ruwasa). Those suspended are Musoma Regional Ruwasa Manager Sadick Chakka, Tarime District Ruwasa Manager Marwa Murasa and Rorya District Ruwasa Manager Evaristo Mgaya. In another development, the minister on Thursday directed the arrest of Mr Emmanuel Masanja for allegedly sabotaging water projects in Rorya. He was arrested on the spot.
