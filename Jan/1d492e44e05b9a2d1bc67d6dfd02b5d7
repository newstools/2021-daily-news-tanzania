MINISTER for Home Affairs George Simbachawene has awarded 1m/- to Corporal Denice Minja from the Fire and Rescue Force (FRF), who last year, rescued two children who had sunk into a  pit latrine. Mr Simbachawene handed over a 1m/- cash prize to Corporal Minja at a colourful ceremony to congratulate him at the ministry’s headquarters in Dodoma. The event was attended by senior officials from the ministry. In May last year, a one-year-old child was rescued from a pit latrine by Corporal Minja, who was Fire Constable by then. The child was dumped into the pit latrine by the mother. Nobody knew the reasons behind such a cruel act. Nevertheless, rescuers went to the scene and the then FRF constable rescued the child. He accepted to take risks as he entered the pit latrine as deep as it was to rescue the child. He was assisted by several colleagues from FRF, who used a rope to lower Minja down the pit latrine. In a video that went viral on social media one could hear the child crying desperately from the pit latrine. Due to his bravery, he was promoted to the rank of corporal by Commissioner General of Fire and Rescue Force (CGF) John Masunga. Briefing the minister yesterday, CGF Masunga said in yet another event, on December 28, 2020, Corporal Minja rescued another two-year old child, Anekius Evarist, who had sunk into a latrine, as the child was looking for her mother, who was taking a shower. “I wrote him a letter to congratulate and appreciate his bravery,’’ he said, adding that after rescuing the two children on December 30, 2020, the Home Affairs Minister directed CGF to bring him to Dodoma so that he could give him a golden handshake. Speaking at the event, Mr Simbachawene said what Corporal Minja had done was exceptional that was why he decided to congratulate him exceptionally. He further paid tribute to other officers who worked together with Corporal Minja to rescue the two children.
