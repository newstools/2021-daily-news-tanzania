PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has said the Government is continuing to execute transport projects across the country which will subsequently unlock geographical opportunities as well as improving people’s lives. The Premier Majaliwa said this at Mbamba Bay Port in Nyasa District, Ruvuma Region as he was launching MV Mbeya.
MV Mbeya will be used to transport both passengers and cargos along Lake Nyasa. He has said since the fifth phase regime came in power, the main focus is to ensure Tanzanians do business in a convenient environment by investing in the transportation sector. 
 
PM Majaliwa said the main objective of focusing on the sector was to stimulate economic activities by making Tanzania a major gateway for trade. He has also called on Tanzanians in and out the country to invest in Nyasa since there is an adequate power supply and improved transport infrastructure including roads and ports. Mr Majaliwa who doubles as Ruangwa MP encouraged young people to exploit opportunities associated with the newly launched vessel.
