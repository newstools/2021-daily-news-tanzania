THERE is bright future for tennis in Tanzania after several coaches from the Tanzania Tennis Coaches Association (TTCA) launched a special development programme for the junior players from Dar es Salaam schools. The recently launched programme has started with two schools while plans are underway to introduce it to other schools and regions countrywide. Tennis coach Hassan Chande said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the programme supports the government’s efforts to promote sports from grass-roots levels for the better future. Chande, who is among the coaches from Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club (DGC) named the schools as Zanaki and Maktaba. “We have started to conduct training to the pupils from these schools every Friday at Zanaki Primary School courts," he explained. He added they have received a good response from trainees as in a short period over 400 students attended the weekly training. Other coaches in the programme are Waziri Rajabu, Edna John and Filbert Markus. Chande further said their target is to reach over 100 primary schools countrywide to introduce, promote and develop the game at individual and regional levels. "After Dar es Salaam our next destination is Dodoma where we plan to select 20 talented players from each school," he added. He said their programme has been blessed by the National Sports Council (NSC) hence; they will make sure to implement it successfully. He said all coaches are committed to work hard towards the desired goal. He, however, admitted that to have smooth run they will need support from other sports well-wishers. "We would like to call upon the companies, institutions and individuals to come forward and support us to make it successful."
