Dar es salaam Regional Commissioner, Abubakar Kunenge has said the government is setting strategies to empower women and make them contribute fully in development through business. Speaking today (January 7, 2021) in Dar es salaam he said ever since the government succeeded in relocating to Dodoma, Dar es salaam City will still remain as a business hub with the women being provided with business training to prosper. Elaborating, the RC noted that the plan is to ensure that Dar es Salaam still attracts cross-border business and especially be gateway to the landlocked countries. Mr Kunenge further said the focus is to ensure they eliminate unnecessary bureaucracies for the traders in obtaining business permits, hence, asked the public to exploit the opportunity.
