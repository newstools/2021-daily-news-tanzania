One of the unique golf tournaments staged at the club, the events honours the former Chief of the Defence Forces (CDF) General Mwita Waitara the founder of the club who did a commendable job in promoting golf at the club, according to the club’s chairman Michael Luwongo. Organised by Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Waitara Golf Trophy has been rescheduled several times before it was confirmed January 23. The club’s Chairman Michael Luwongo told the ‘Sunday News’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that preparation for the event has begun and the event will tee off as planned next week. He said they have decided to postpone it due to the reasons beyond their control. Among them was a loss of one the General (rtd) George Waitara mother in mid-November last year. Over 150 golfers across to the country had already confirmed their participation to play in the 18-hole stroke play event and now with additional ten golfers from Malawi, the number may hit 160 golfers. Explaining further on the tournament, Luwongo said that the prestigious club competition meant to honour General Waitara, who is the founder of the par-72 Lugalo Golf course and the chief player in developing golf at the club. Luwongo pointed out that due to the nature of tournament’s main sponsor Serengeti Breweries Ltd, there will be no junior category this time around. However, he said that professional golfers, who will be battling it out for the cash prizes, were also invited and they were due to tee off tomorrow. He thanked Serengeti Breweries for their tireless support to the club and co-sponsor Tanzania Forest Agency who joined them this year.
