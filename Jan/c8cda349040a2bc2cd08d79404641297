BOTH indices climbed during the last week of the year 2020 as some cross listed counters as well as JATU maintained a rally. The All Share Index (DSEI) gained 4.76 points to close the week at 1,816.88 points following a 0.33 per cent growth of the total market capitalisation. The total market cap closed the week at TZS 15,094.71bln ($6.53bln). Despite the recent weeks’ rally of cross listed counters, the total market cap is still down 11.71 per cent compared to the beginning of the year 2020, while the DSEI lost 242.33 points during the year. The only cross listed counter that maintained a rally during the last week of the year was KCB Bank which gained 3.18 per cent, and due to its magnitude it was enough to influence the DSEI into a net appreciation. KCB is down 32.5 per cent since the beginning of the year 2020, in a year that was highly affected by lockdowns hence significant slowdown of business activities in Kenya and most countries. East African Breweries (EABL) slightly went down by 0.61 per cent during the week while showing a 25.8 per cent slowdown since the beginning of 2020. National Media Group (NMG) and Jubilee Holdings (JHL) both fell as well by 4.48 per cent and 4.17 per cent during the week respectively. On an annual basis NMG and JHL both fell by 64 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. Kenya Airways (KQ) which remained stationary during the week because of its suspension from trading, although, despite its troubles, the airline was up 60 per cent during the time of its suspension compared to the beginning of the year. The Tanzania Share Index (TSI) gained a 0.75 point following a 0.13 per cent rise of the domestic market capitalisation which closed the week at TZS 9,161.60bln ($3.97bln). The TSI closed the week at 3,484.53 points at the end of the week and year. The TSI and domestic market cap are both up 53.43 points and 1.68 per cent respectively since the beginning of the year 2020. The rally during the week originates from the surprise that persists on the JATU counter where company fundamentals are being totally defied or rather different fundamentals from the company’s books are being used to determine value of the company. The counter went up by 44.66 per cent during the week, closing at a price of 2,980/- per share. The counter has risen by seven folds in a month, since it was listed during late November 2020. Early investors are looking at a paper wealth growth of 609 per cent that is easily cashed in considering the significant demand that perseveres for the counter. NMB pulled off a surprising transaction during the week, which involved about 34.9 per cent of the total capital size of the bank. The magnitude of the transaction is only second to Vodacom Group SA and Mirambo (T) last year, involving Vodacom (T) shares. The NMB transaction involved 174,500,000 shares of NMB which were traded at a price of 2,410/- per share, in a single prearranged block transaction and realised a turnover of TZS 420.5bln ($182.06mln). Following the transaction on the NMB counter, the total equity turnover sharply rose on a weekly basis to a total of TZS 420.91bln ($182.22mln) compared to TZS 1.86bln ($0.804mln) during the previous week. The number of deals rose from 152 to 176. If we normalise the NMB block transaction, the equity turnover amounts to TZS 368.6mln ($0.16mln) which is 80 per cent lower compared to the previous week. The transaction on the NMB counter has highly influenced the balance of participation between foreign and local investors. Foreign investors participation side was only seen on Monday during the transaction of NMB where by 100 per cent of divestments during the day was from foreign investors while 99.95 per cent was from local investors. Foreign investors were net sellers during the week after accounting for 99.97 per cent of the total weekly divestments. Local investors accounted for 99.95 per cent of the total investments during the week. Market, Bills and Bonds The value of transactions on the Interbank Cash Market (IBCM) went up by 25 per cent on a weekly basis although it was still 68.9 per cent higher than compared to the week before last. The value of transactions stood at TZS 63bln ($27.27mln). The interbank rate maintained volatility after losing 45bps in a week. The weighted average interbank rate closed the week at 3.73 per cent. Currency Market With a lack of an outlier value of transactions, the amount traded on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) went down by 88.7 per cent to a total of $9.97mln. Despite the weekly free fall, the amount is still 139 per cent higher than the amount traded during the week before. The shilling slightly gained strength since the humongous transaction on 23rd December 2020, but slightly depreciated by a pip on a weekly basis. The shilling closed the week at TZS 2,309.90/USD.
