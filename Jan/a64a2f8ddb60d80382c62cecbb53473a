THE construction of staff houses, timely remuneration and other benefits in public and private sectors boost the morale and efficiency of the staff. Speaking during the launch of the construction of a residential house for the secretary of CCM youth wing (UVCCM), national chairman Kheri James said at the weekend: “I would like to congratulate UVCCM in Kilimanjaro Region under the chairmanship of Mr Ivan Moshi on embarking on different development projects as far as UVCCM is concerned in Kilimanjaro Region, which include the construction of a residential house which will be used to house the UVCCM regional secretary,” he said. Mr James went on to say that UVCCM was the main foundation when it came to preparing future leaders of Tanzania and that by showing their prowess through embarking on different development projects, UVCCM in Kilimanjaro Region showed clearly that it was playing a big role in creating future competent leaders. In addition, Mr James, who by the virtue of his post as the national chairman of UVCCM is also a member of the Central Committee (CC) of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of CCM, used the opportunity to congratulate all stakeholders on supporting UVCCM efforts at regional level. In another development, Mr James commended CCM members in Kilimanjaro Region for cooperation and the unity they showed which led to the ruling party’s landslide victory in the region during the general election held countrywide in October last year. “I would like to take this opportunity to urge all CCM members to cooperate with the newly elected CCM leaders at all levels of council and parliament in their core responsibilities aimed at serving the people in the coming five years,” he said.
