THE United Nations Association of Tanzania (UNA) has pledged to cooperate with the government to ensure a 10 per cent loan issued by councils and municipal councils in the country to benefit intended groups. UNA Youth Empowerment Projects Manager Lucas Fidelis made the pledge during a stakeholders’ workshop, which aimed at analysing loan regulations and ensure the groups benefitted from the loans. “Despite challenges, we commend the government for continuing working on them through the views presented by the youth and other groups ... some councils have failed to issue loans simply because the needy have not reached the required number as per regulations,” he said. Mr Fidelis said UNA dealt with policy formulation, youth empowerment in leadership and development and presented them to the government through the Regional Administration and Local Government. He commended the government for continuing issuing loans through district and municipal councils to women, the youth and people with disabilities. For his part, director of a nongovernmental organisation (Babawatoto) Mgunga Mnyenyelwa, who was implementing a youth project known as ‘VijanaTwende’ said the project aimed at building youth capacity through 4 per cent loans issued by Dar es Salaam municipal councils. “Our government has helped us a lot to empower youth economically, by providing them with loans. Our work is to build capacity on how they can access loans and utilise them,” he said. He added that, they would also make an assessment on the progress of a youth project implemented in Dar es Salaam and get to know the challenges encountered by the youth while implementing their project. The workshop was attended by the youth, social development officers from Ilala, Temeke, Ubungo, Kinondoni, Kigamboni municipal council.
