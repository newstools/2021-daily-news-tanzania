Uganda's electoral agency chief on Saturday credited opposition frontrunner Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, with 3,119,965 votes as his percentage surged to 34.62 percent, according to the Daily Nation. In the latest announcement of results, National Resistance Movement (NRM) party presidential candidate Yoweri Kaguta Museveni’s percentage lead significantly dwindled from 61.98 to 58.83 percent. This is the first time incumbent president Museveni’s percentage vote count fell below 60 percent since tallying commenced Thursday at the national tally centre in Kyambogo, Kampala. However, should Mr Museveni maintain a lead above 50 percent, he stands a chance to win and extend his rule to 40 years. According to the country's electoral commission's provisional results, Museveni is pacing with 5,303,831 votes of the 9,100,865 valid votes in.
