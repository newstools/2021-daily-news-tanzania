MASWA District Commissioner (DC), Aswege Kaminyoge has smelt something fishy on a project involving construction of a dispensary at Zebeya village, where government allocated over 200m/-. He directed the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in the district to conduct thorough investigation and take legal action on those proved to have embezzled the funds. Mr Kaminyoge issued the directive when he led a team comprising members of the defense and security committee, which inspected development of the project. He was vividly disappointed by a report by the District Engineer, indicating that to-date, the Out-Patient Ward (OPD) had cost about 108m/-, while a theatre ward cost a total of 118/-. "The project, which was expected to have been completed by September 10th, last year, has stalled. I hereby task PCCB to conduct thorough investigation and prosecute those who stole the funds," he said. Acting Maswa District Executive Director (DED), Vivian Christian promised to take stern action on unfaithful officials who collude with contractors to swindle government funds.
