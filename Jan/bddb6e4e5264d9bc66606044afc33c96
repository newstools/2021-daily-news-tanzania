Zanzibar President, Dr. Hussein Ali Mwinyi has asked Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) leaders in the island to cooperate and work with the residents so as to solve their problems for development purposes. Speaking in a forum of Revolutionary Party Communities earlier today (January 6, 2020) at Sheikh Idriss Abdulwakil Kikwajuni in Unguja, he said their main responsibility is to ensure the citizens' challenges are addressed. Dr. Mwinyi further said the leaders should form a system that will enable them to have a direct contact with the public in the course of solving their problems. However, he asked the public to support the government in the fight against the misuse of office and related crimes in the Isles.
