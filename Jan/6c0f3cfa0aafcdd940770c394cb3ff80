ROMBO District authority has stressed the importance of using electronic fiscal devices (EFD) machines to curb tax evasion and strengthen business record keeping. Speaking recently during the opening of training of entrepreneurs aimed at providing education on the importance of using EFD machines, Rombo District Commissioner (DC), Dr Athuman Kihamia, commended Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in the district for the good job that had contributed to the improvement of the national economy. "With their dedication, the officials of this important institution in the country have fulfilled the main objective of establishing TRA which was to ensure the government becomes strong and steady enough to serve its people," he said. Earlier, Kilimanjaro Regional TRA Manager Gabriel Mwangosi said apart from providing revenue to the nation, the issuance of receipts was also important to traders as they helped in business record keeping. "The use of receipts have revolutionised businesses and consumer spending and that's why we (TRA) are committed to providing education on the use of EFDs, the importance of issuing receipts and the importance of customers to demand receipts after purchasing goods," he said.
