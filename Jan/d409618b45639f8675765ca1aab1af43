Samcrete CEO Mr Sherif Nazmy said his company is convinced by the conducive investment environment in Zanzibar. “We can now think of an investment project to start with in the near future,” Mr Nazmy said. He said, “It is fortunate that there are many opportunities in Zanzibar, we have started to discuss possible projects to begin with. We thank the government for the good reception.”
