THE Rotary Club of Oysterbay Dar es Salaam and Rotary of Ukonga Mwembe Madafu handed over renovated classrooms worth 8m/- to Juhudi Primary School located at Ukonga, aiming to support efforts of the government to provide education services to the public. Briefing reporters in Dar es Salaam during the handover of renovated classrooms on Tuesday, the new Club Advisor, Mr Benoit Ducarme said the donation aimed at uplifting education standards and making the general learning environment conducive to both pupils and teachers. He further said the Clubs hoped that students will embrace the support which focused on increasing their performance. “Our Clubs’ core objective is to contribute to an improved learning environment for quality education in schools,” he said. Ukonga Ward Executive Officer (WEO), Mr Ibrahim Ramadhani thanked the Rotary Clubs for their support, and called on other institutions to continue supporting the government's efforts in bringing development to help the community. He urged students and teachers to make good use of school infrastructure, and that they will also continue to work closely with all schools to ensure that the ward becomes a role model in education. Mr Ramadhani mentioned that in Ukonga ward there are eight schools and some have poor infrastructure. Ms Bigwa Ibrahim, a resident of Ukonga ward, commented that it is a big help for their school because the old classrooms were not in a friendly environment for children to study well. Rotary has seven areas of focus that include basic education and literacy, peace and conflict prevention/ resolution, disease prevention and treatments, water and sanitation, maternal and child health, economic and community development and the environment. The Rotary Club of Oysterbay was founded in 2009, and currently has 75 members. It is the largest of the nine Rotary Clubs in Dar es Salaam and supports the community with a wide range of projects.
