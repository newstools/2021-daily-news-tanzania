INSTALLATION of a flow meter at Mtwara Port has reached 98 per cent and after completion port authorities will be able to establish the amount of fuel discharged at the facility. The flow meter, to be used for discharging petrol and diesel, will also increase government revenue because there will be no manual estimations of fuel entering the port, according to Mtwara Port Manager Juma Kijavara. Briefing members of the Tanzania Shipping Agency Corporation (Tasac) Board of Directors who toured the port, Mr Kijavara said they aimed at providing services to fuel marine tankers by ensuring fuel from the facility passed through the flow meter before being transported to southern regions and neighbouring countries, including Malawi and Zambia. Mr Kijavara said previously, the port was receiving fuel, but verification and various charges were estimated manually and the government was not getting enough revenue. “After installation the amount of fuel will be known and facilitate the collection of levies and ensure that traders pay appropriate levies... our goal is to see that we receive oil tankers and the country starts benefitting especially from countries which will be using our port,” he said. For his part, a member of Tasac Board of Directors, Mr Mussa Mandia, said Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA)’s move was positive and the flow meter would address challenges facing TPA. “This will increase efficiency by minimising docking time and congestion. It will also improve cargo security,”explained Mr Mandia. According to TPA, so far three ports – Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Mtwara - have been installed with flow meters.
