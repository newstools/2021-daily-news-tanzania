PRECISION Air has secured its Aircraft Operation Certificate (AOC) after undergoing Aircraft Operation Certificate (AOC) inspection in December last year by inspectors from Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCCA). Commenting on the achievement, Precision Air’s Managing Director and CEO Mr Patrick Mwanri said in Dar es Salaam on Monday that the renewal of the AOC is the continuation of Precision’s commitment to serve the country and beyond while observing rules and regulations of aircraft operations. “We are happy to receive our new AOC certificate and we would like to thank Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) for a professional inspection process,” he said. He added, on behalf of the management, I commend Precision Air team for maintaining our standards and always looking for areas of improvement which has resulted to this achievement. This was also possible through their commitment to professionalism. The Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) listed company, Precision Air has been able to renew its AOC for 27 years consecutively from 1993 when it was first registered as a commercial schedule and non-schedule airline. Now operating a fleet of nine aircrafts, it is the second designated national carrier operating to 11 domestic and regional destinations. The AOC is the certification granted by TCAA and it gives permission to Airline Company to do commercial operations within the country and beyond, basing on Bilateral Air Services Agreements (BASA). This certification is issued after intensive review process done by TCAA inspectors and it is renewable annually.
