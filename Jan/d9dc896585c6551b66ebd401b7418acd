STAKEHOLDERS of the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth (SWIOFish) yesterday organised a virtual meeting to assess achievements and challenges encountered during its implementation before giving way for the second phase. The Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Dr Rashid Tamatamah made the brief at an ordinary routine meeting being implemented by the World Bank (WB) as the chief financier as well as other partners. Explaining, Dr Tamatamah noted that the assessment aims at uplifting areas, which seem to be lagging behind. “Since the six years project took off in 2015, it has continued to receive encouraging reports from development partners. “The financiers are quite pleased with the implementation of the project in all areas, including funding and the construction of buildings… it gives us confidence to see that the project is implemented as agreed,” noted the PS. He further said they had submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance to extend the project implementation period to 2022 instead of planned 2021, simply to compensate for the lost time forced by the Covid-19 outbreak. Dr Tamatamah noted that due to the Covid-19 crisis, some countries had to issue travel bans and that was why parties to the project were meeting virtually. He, however, stressed that the World Bank had pledged to support Tanzania to implement its blue economy agenda, citing the ministry’s commitment to protect marine resources in further developing fishing activities. Participants in the project included the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Natural Resource and Tourism and the Deep Sea Fishing Authority. The SWIOFish Project was established in 2015 to encourage the protection of marine resources and conserve the coastal ecosystem, including beaches.
