The incident happened in Sengerema District oin Wednesday( January 6, 2021), during a tour by the minister to inspect development projects being implemented in the area. This followed complaints raised by Mr Christopher Derefa, a resident of Ibisabageni village in Sengerema district for delayed payments and abusive language he was getting as a result of following his land issue, located at Bukara area in Sengerema district. He informed Mr Jafo that he offered his piece of land for the construction of the District Council Offices and he was claiming only 4,686,464/- and instead, he was paid 1,496,874/- and the rest not known to be when. When Mr Jafo asked for clarification from the two officials, they responded that the matter had already been solved and Mr Derefa had already been paid all his dues. In the event, Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr John Mogella ordered the two officials to be arrested for giving false information. He said that public officials should be committed and solve problems facing the people instead of waiting for national leaders to visit the areas. Commenting, Sengerema District Commissioner, Dr Emmanuel Kipole, surprised the minister, when he said that he had been informed that the old man’s payment had already been cleared and he deserved no payment again. In reaction, the minister ordered for the immediate payment of Mr Derefa’s money, while cautioning public officials to be accountable.
