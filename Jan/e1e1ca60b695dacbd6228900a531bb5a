Others who left the club include the veteran defender Kelvin Yondani who has joined Polisi Tanzania, Juma Abdul, Tariq Kiakala and Juma Mahadhi who serves Ihefu FC. Gwambina’s Competition Director, Mohamed Almas unveiled this week the move to recruit Ngasa in plan of the Head Coach, Fulgence Novatus and technical director, Mwinyi Zahera. “The deal with Ngassa is almost sealed. His signing was proposed by the Head Coach and passed by the technical director, Zahera,” he explained. Adding, he said the management of Gwambina expects much from him as his national team scoring record convinces the management that he will deliver at the club.
