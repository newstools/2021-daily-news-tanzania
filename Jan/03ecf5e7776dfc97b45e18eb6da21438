KIPANGA and KVZ stamped vital victories in the Isles Premier League matches held in separate venues here on Thursday. Kipanga from Pemba Island laboured to beat Black Sailor 2-1 in hotly contested match at Amaan Stadium in Unguja. Determined Kipanga were the first to open goal account early in the first half through Neva Adelin Kibona who also netted the second a few seconds before the end of the first half. Kipanga completed the first half leading 2-0. The Armed Force boys began the second half strongly, but they were unfortunate this time as wasted a good number of scoring chances. Black Sailor’s defence line defended in numbers to the extent they denied Kipanga from winning by a big margin. Black Sailor woke up from a slumber and began to raid Kipanga goal with cautious move and it didn’t take them long before seeing their opponents’ back of the net. It was Ayoub Boniface Kaheke who scored his team’s consolation goal in the 46th minute. No more goals were scored despite both teams making attempts to change the stalemate. At Mao Zedong stadium in Unguja, KVZ defeated Mafunzo 1-0 in a thrilling encounter on Thursday. Talib Hamad ‘Andason’ was the scorer of the winner. After winning the game, Kipanga have penned 18 points to remain second behind the leaders KMKM while Black Sailor, with 14 points, have remained at the 5th position.
