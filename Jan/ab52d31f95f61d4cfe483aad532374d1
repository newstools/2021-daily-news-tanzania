ABOUT 12,110 households out of the targeted 324,631 in Geita Region, equivalent to 3.7 per cent, have been reached with Community Health Fund (CHF) services, according to Regional CHF Coordinator Paul John. In an interview with ‘Daily News’ mid-this week, Mr John said there was a good response in Geita Urban where 3,347 households were registered - 2,550 (Chato), 2,342 (Mbogwe), 2,099 (Geita Rural), 1,218 (Bukombe) and 554 (Nyang’hwale District). “This is due to the fact that this improved CHF was introduced in 2018. We want to reach out to as many Tanzanians as possible,” he said. Over 500 public dissemination officers were stationed in various areas of the region. “We expect that all targeted households will be covered by the end of this year.” “However, rural penetration sometimes is difficult due to poor roads and a shortage of resource,” he said, calling on more support from various stakeholders. He explained that a household with six members had to pay 30,000/- annually, equal to 5,000/- per head. “Members are to have health services from dispensary to regional referral hospital.” Iborelo resident in Geita, Ms Tatu Nyembo, is among the CHF beneficiaries who commended the government for improving health services, including the introduction of CHF.
