Deputy Chief Secretary in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government (PO-RALG), Gerald Mweli, has urged head teachers and country ward education officers to accord new teachers with proper support and conducive educational environment so that they can be more efficient. Speaking at Ukerewe District in Mwanza Region when he met head teachers and ward education coordinators, Mweli said it is important to supervise the new recruited teachers and help them enjoy their jobs since most of them are still young and still fresh graduates “I want head teachers and education officers in all wards to ensure that they assist the new teachers by providing them with good teaching environment, because apart from that they tend to despise their appointed centers” Said Mwelu.
