EQUITY for Tanzania (EFTA) in collaboration with Africarriers has launched a collateral-free school bus loan campaign. The loan programme campaign aimes at providing low cost buses without security to enable schools to address transport challenges. EFTA Chief Executive Officer Buckley Coy said a school bus loan programme would be made reasonable to afford for all interested schools countrywide. â€œThis product aims at boosting schools and improving their services as a recovery plan from the coronavirus pandemic as well as facilitate school," he said. The CEO noted that after conducting a survey, EFTA and Africarriers developed a programme that catered for school needs of providing reliable services while at the same time ensuring safety among students using school transport facilities. The Africarriers Company General Manager (Sales) Mohamed Ladha said the company was ready to supply between 200 and 1,000 school buses in a month, depending on orders. "Our concept is to provide brand new busses to schools and this is because they will last longer, also enable students to overcome regular commuter bus challenges," he said. Earlier, EFTA Head of Sales Clerius Asiel said apart from providing collateral-free loans, the programme accepted only a down payment of 20 per cent. EFTA Marketing Manager Peter Temu said though the programme was launched in Moshi, other schools might access the service through their other offices in Arusha, Mwanza, Mbeya, Kagera, Morogoro, Dar es Salaam and Dodoma.
