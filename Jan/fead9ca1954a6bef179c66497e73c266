AS the government woos investors to invest in Pemba, residents have been told to get prepared to utilise opportunities that will be created from various projects. "I urge residents particularly the youth to utilise different opportunities, including employment and doing business during this era of tourism business in Pemba," Mr Khatib Juma Mjaja, Tourism and Heritage Officer in Pemba, said. He said this during the opening of tourism stakeholdersâ€™ meeting held in Pemba where the government was promoting investment mainly in tourism which had not been developed much. Mr Mjaja said the government had been encouraging both local and foreign investors to establish projects in Pemba and that infrastructures had been improved to facilitate movements and communications. Pemba is a famous Island for cloves, but plans are underway to construct industries. Pemba is also rich in historical sites, including caves and monuments, and leaders, including Minister for Tourism and Heritage Lela Mohamed Mussa also encouraged investment in Pemba. Already there are foreign companies which have shown interest in investing in Pemba Island. A seaweed processing factory and five-star hotels are some of the projects under way in different parts of Pemba, including Micheweni Economic Zone. Dr Hussein Ali Mwinyi is touting Pemba, saying it is a special focus for investment to match Unguja Island where many investors are running development projects.
