THE government has completed the expansion of 55bn/- Bulyanhulu Sub-power Station in Kahama District, Shinyanga Region, that will serve Geita and Kigoma regions. Minister for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, announced the good news for Geita and Kigoma residents recently when he visited the project, whose implementation started in September and ended in November last year. The sub-station receives power from the national grid at Ibadakuli location in Shinyanga Region. “The government decided to expand this sub-station so that it may transfer high amount of electricity to neighbouring regions of Geita and Kigoma. It wasn’t an easy task as experts found the land so hard, but tried their best and completed the work in a short time. It is now in full operations,” said the minister. He further clarified that the project was of most importance as it also supplied power to 39 villages, with 32 villages that had been so far reached. Dr Kalemani had also directed the Tanesco staff to clear trees that touched electrical wires in two weeks, as they were causes of regular power cuts. Sub-station Supervisor Amos Asheli said there was reliable power supply to those two regions and villages on the main way after project completion.
