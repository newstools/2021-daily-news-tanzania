THE ongoing rains have boosted the business of roasted maize consumption by 75 per cent in Dar es Salaam. A spot-check survey conducted by the ‘DAILY NEWS’ met a number of trucks carrying maize loads to Dar es Salaam, with an agent saying they receive 20 lorries up from 10 a day. The survey revealed that most farmers target cold season when business is flouring and demand high as the best period to release their stocks. However, the ongoing rains have favoured and raised maize roasting business with one truck carrying more than 16,000 sacks per day to the city. At Mawasiliano Market, its chairman Meshack Lwamba said the business has increased due to the climate change with more than 20 trucks offloading maize loads on daily basis in comparison to less than 10 trucks in the past seasons. In fact, roasted maize is very appealing during the cold season, because a person can eat one and still longs for more and this is why the business is growing in this rainy season, said Mr Lwamba. The chairman noted that the stocks are brought from different parts of the upcountry citing some as Mbeya and Iringa Regions.
