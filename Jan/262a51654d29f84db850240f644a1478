TANZANIA’S veteran netball player and inspirational figure in sport’s development, Judith Ilunda was a brilliant start of the sports bonanza staged on Saturday at TCC Chang’ombe courts in Dar es Salaam. Irunda who has played for Bandari netball team since the mid 1980 helped her team to outshine TAZARA in a thrilling match staged at the venue. The sports festival was organised by the Ministry of Works and Transport and was perfectly coordinated by Tanzania Airport Authority (TAA). The veteran star was a dynamo of her team’s 8-3 victory over Tazara as she managed to overpower her marker Rehema Fungafunga and score vital goals. Speaking after the bonanza, Ilunda said netball is in her blood that’s why she has played it for over three decades and served as the leader of Tanzania Netball Association (CHANETA) for many years. Other major sports activities staged at the venue yesterday included football and tug of war. The secretary general of Transports Club, Mbura Tenga urged other institutions to set budgets for sports that will enable members of the staff to conduct sports activities. He said many institutions ignore sports to the extents they don’t give their staff an opportunity to play sports. He urged the institutions and government agencies to prepare between 2m/- to 8m/- as sports budget. He suggested the next bonanza to be held in Tanzanian capital, Dodoma.
