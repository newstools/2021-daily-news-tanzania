Four Kakonko District residents have been taken to court for allegedly impregnating four Kasanda Secondary Schoolgirls in Kigoma Region According to the Kasanda Ward Councilor, Dickson Barutwa report such cases have been on the rise, and only few cases are traced. He further said in some instances, some parents report them and then prefer to solve them at family level, creating a loophole for the suspects to walk escort free. However, some have complained that the culture is affecting their children, who drop out of school and become abandoned by men who impregnate them.
