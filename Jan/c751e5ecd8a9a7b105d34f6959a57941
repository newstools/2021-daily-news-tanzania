Biashara United should thank Deogratius Mafie, whose goal was enough to give them three crucial away points. The hosts, tried but in vain to equalise. Mrisho Ngasa, who is a new signing for Gwambina from Young Africans as a free agent could not help his side from defeat. The win promotes Biashara United one step to the fourth place with 29 points from 18 matches, leap frogging Ruvu Shooting with 28 points. Gwambina are in the 14th out of 18 teams with 19 points from 16 matches. The league is led by Young Africans with 44 points from 18 matches, followed by Simba Sports Club with 35 points from 15 matches. Despite losing, Gwambina dominated the match, but have themselves to blame for their strikers being off target. They had seven off target shots compared to five of their opponents. They also got four corner balls that could have resulted into goals but Biashara Unitedâ€™s defenders stood firm to thwart all the dangerous moves. Biashara, on the other hand, had three on target shots and one of them bore fruits for them to earn a goal.
