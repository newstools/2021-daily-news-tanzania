DEPUTY Minister of State in the Vice President’s Office (Union and Environment) Mwita Waitara has directed immediate removal of waste at Sirari Market in Tarime District, Mara Region. Mr Waitara issued the directive on Thursday after visiting the market to inspect cleanliness. Residents from all walks of life, including ordinary businessmen and women flocked to the market and complained about the deputy minister, calling for action against Tarime District Council officials for failing to remove garbage. “This waste is burden to us and it is a long time problem. We ask for help,” several citizens complained in front of the deputy minister. In response, Mr Waitara directed Tarime District Council Executive Director (DED) Apoo Castro Tindwa not to celebrate New Year and instead ensure waste was removed from the market surrounded by business premises and several women selling foodstuffs. “Tomorrow (Friday) there will be no New Year celebrations for DED and his colleagues. They must come to remove this waste,” Mr Waitara, who is also an MP for Tarime Rural Constituency, said. He promised to return to Sirari to see whether his directives had been implemented. He wondered why the district council had failed to manage waste despite that it was earning an average of 36m/- each year. Residents surrounding the market demanded investigation into what they described as 60m/- spent by the council to build a garbage store. “How come that they (district council) have spent 60m/- to construct a waste store and it has never been used,” the new Sirari Ward councillor, Mr Amos Sagara, said. The deputy minister said officials involved in the construction of the waste store should be held accountable. Mr Waitara also directed Tarime Town Council to shift its dump from Starehe, which was close to residential houses. He also warned town council environmental officials against turning roads into waste dumps.
