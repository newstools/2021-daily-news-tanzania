THE new US President Joe Biden has begun to undo some of Donald Trump regime's key policies, hours after being sworn in. In his initial acts as the 46th US President, he signed 15 executive orders - the first to boost the Federal response to the coronavirus crisis, according to BBC. Other orders reversed the Trump administration's stance on climate change and immigration. President Biden set to work at the Oval Office having been sworn in earlier on Wednesday at the US Capitol.
