US President Donald Trump has been permanently suspended from Twitter in what BBC reports: "due to the risk of further incitement of violence". It is reported that Twitter said the decision was made "after close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account". It comes amid a Big Tech purge of the online platforms used by Trump and his supporters. Some lawmakers and celebrities have been calling for years on Twitter to ban Trump altogether. Former First Lady Michelle Obama tweeted on Thursday that the Silicon Valley giants should stop enabling Trump's "monstrous behaviour" and permanently expel him.
