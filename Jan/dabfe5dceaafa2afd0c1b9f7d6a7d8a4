DEPUTY Minister for Constitutional and Legal Affairs Godfrey Mizengo Pinda has expressed his dismay at the prisoners’ congestion he witnessed at the regional prison in Mpanda Municipal Council. According to the deputy minister who toured the region recently, the prison facility, which has the capacity to accommodate 100 inmates, currently accommodates more than 300 prisoners. The deputy minister was briefed on the situation during his inspection of the ongoing construction of new court premises in municipal council. He thus directed the Katavi Regional Prisons Service to construct more cells to mitigate congestion. “Congestion at the facility is awesome and the situation should be addressed permanently...The facility, whose capacity is to accommodate only 100 inmates, has now more than 300 prisoners. I urge the Katavi Regional Prisons Service to increase the number of cells to reduce congestion of inmates at the prison facility,” added the deputy minister. Mr Pinda also spoke to inmates at the facility.
