President John Magufuli has directed the Ministry of Finance to re-route 2.5 bn/- to the Prison Department to support them accomplish their pending projects. Speaking at Msalato in Dodoma Region on Thursday during the inauguration of new houses built by the Prison at 900 m/-, President Magufuli nodded to cost, saying their efforts and determination worth emulation by other sectors. Elaborating, Dr Magufuli said he could not believe the department could construct such wonderful houses at such a low cost, saying: “It is high time Prison Wardens lived in quality and standard houses, I will still collaborate in addressing their challenges.”
