BUKOBA District Commissioner (DC) Deodatus KInawiro has appealed to residents living in flood prone areas to relocate to safer areas. He issued the warning on Friday when he visited Bukoba Municipal Council's Miembeni Ward where over 100 houses were flooded because of the ongoing rain. "People living in flood-prone areas should relocate to safer areas. Tanzania Meteorological Authority (TMA) wealth forecast indicates that Kagera Region will get normal to above normal rain between March and May this year. All 14 wards comprising Bukoba Municipal Council should take precautions through cleaning trenches to allow water to flow freely and maintain sanitation standards to avoid contracting contagious diseases," he said. He listed some of the flood prone areas as Hamgembe Ward (Kashabo), Kashai Ward (Matopeni) and Miembeni (Nyamkazi).
