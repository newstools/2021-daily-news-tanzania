RUKWA Regional Commissioner (RC) Joachim Wangabo has issued a two week ultimatum to all civil servants who allegedly misappropriated over 930m/- to refund it short of which they will face legal action. The civil servants are ward and village executive officers employed by councils and were tasked to collect domestic revenue and instead they misappropriated it. The RC has also directed Rukwa Regional Prevention and Combating of the Corruption Bureau (PCCB) Commander Yustina Changaka to investigate all development projects and strategic projects whose contracts have been signed by councils. Mr Wangabo likened the culprits to an army of ants bent on paralysing councils financially by misappropriating public funds. The RC warned that he had already directed the anticorruption watch dog to track, arrest and arraign all culprits. He issued such directives while addressing a regional consultative committee meeting held in the municipal council recently. He explained that despite the efforts he made previously to hand over some suspects to PCCB officials, nothing had changed as there were still many culprits whose employers had not taken them to task.
