IN the coming week, we still prospect that the market will remain vibrant going forward specifically on the banking sector and Industrial sector. We have witnessed share price movement in the local counters which amplifies that there is demand in the market that will drive market activities during the week. The market will remain active during the week and mainly from the top local active counters. JATU share price appreciation thanks to higher demand then the supply in the market, CRDB activities as value investors continues swamp in this counter despite the dividend dilemma. Other top counters expected to transact during the week include TBL, TPCC, NICOL, SWIS and DSE. In midweek we expect a 15-year Treasury bond auction to be held by the central bank. There could be slight increase in the WAY, as the treasuries yields have started to increase. Higher demand for longterm instruments due to handsome yields will continue and hence higher chance of oversubscription in the coming auction. Yields on treasuries will continue to increase but at a slight basis point. In the interbank cash market, despite the decrease in the Weighted average rate (WAR) during the previous week, we still reiterate anticipate that WAR will continue to be stable and within a range of 3.50 per cent to 4.00 per cent with slight volatility in the high and low rate.
