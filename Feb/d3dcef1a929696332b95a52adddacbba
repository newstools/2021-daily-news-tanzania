TANGA Regional Commissioner, Martine Shigella has revealed plans of renaming a modern Korogwe Bus Stand after Engineer Ambassador John Kijazi. Speaking at the requiem mass for the late Chief Secretary Engineer Kijazi in Korogwe on Saturday, RC Shigella said the decision was reached purposely to keep the name of the fallen diplomat immortal. “I and my colleagues have agreed that our main bus stand here in Korogwe which was built with a lot of money and opened by our President John Joseph Magufuli in 2017 will be named after Engineer Ambassador Kijazi,” declared RC Shigella . Ambassador Kijazi died at Benjamin Mkapa Hospital in Dodoma Capital City, where he was receiving treatments. According to his relative, Allan Kijazi, former Chief Secretary died from a heart attack.
