The number of tourists visiting Kazimzumbwi Nature Forest Reserve in Kisarawe, Coast region has significantly increased six times thanks to massive promotions. Data showed that forest received some 533 visitors in 2016/17 and before the end of 2020/21, the number shot to 3,000 demonstrating that awareness campaigned has paid off. Kisarawe District Commissioner (DC) Jokate Mwigelo thus advised the residents to seize the opportunities in the tourism sector to generate incomes and contribute to the economic growth. The DC made the observation, while addressing the residents at the Kisarawe ‘Ushoroba Festival’ ahead of its celebrations for three days from February 19 to 21. “In these three days of the festival there will be different activities including visits to the nature reserves and other tourist sites so that people explore the beauty of our new Kisarawe,” she said. The DC said the aim of the Usharoba festival is to explore and promote the domestic tourism in the district through Pugu - Kazimzumbwi Nature Forest Reserve. Ms Mwigelo added the festival will help to map Kisarawe as a great Nyerere National Park, which is part of Selous Game Reserve-a corridor to different tourism hotspot and explore the beauty of the country. The festival is scheduled to be held at Chanzige Secondary School ground, where the guest of the honor is expected to be the Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Dr Damas Ndumbaro. On his part, Nyerere National Park Conservationist, Seth Mihayo, said through the Usharoba festival there will be an increase in the number of tourists from the district level and the country as a whole. A representative from WWF, Dr Severine Kalonga, said that the forest adapting to climate change, also hosts local tourists, hence an opportunity for the residents to do business.
