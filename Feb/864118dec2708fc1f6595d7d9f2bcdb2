President John Magufuli has asked the High Court of Tanzania and other lawmakers in the country to make good use of Kiswahili Law Dictionary that was initiated in 1999. The President made the revelation today while in Dodoma Region after swearing-in Judge Zephrine Galeba as a Judge in the Court of Appeal, adding that it will further dispense justice, because it's a local language they speak and understand. Elaborating, he said liberation of the country from the yoke of colonialism by the father of the nation, Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere involved using Kiswahili to unite more than 121 tribes to form a joint force and he succeeded. Dr Magufuli further insisted that the language since then has been uniting Tanzania and therefore it is fair enough for the judiciary to adopt it in its court affairs and rulings. However, he expressed disappointment at the failure of some leaders not using Kiswahili that has become the country’s mother tongue language, saying its relegating what belongs to the nation, adding: “I would require the newly appointed Judge to ensure he develops the usage of Kiswahili in the Court of appeal.”
