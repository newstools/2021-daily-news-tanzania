THE contractor, Tender International Company Ltd from China, contracted to construct Vocational Training Centre at over 10.7bn/- has voluntarily thrown in the towel due to incompetence, it was said yesterday. The project is constructed at Muva in Rukwa Municipal Council, bankrolled by the African Development Bank (AfDB). Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC) Joachim Wangabo, accompanied by members of the regional consultative committee (RCC), visited the site and learnt that the construction of the project had been stalled since January 14, last year. Project supervisor Jerome Longido briefed the RC that the implementation of the project was planned as per contractual agreement to be accomplished on September 22, 2019. But the contractor, Tender International Company Ltd, was given additional 100 days to complete the project, but by December 31, 2019 he had failed to meet the deadline. “Finally on January 14, last year, the contractor wrote a letter that he could not continue with the project so since then to date the implementation of the project has stalled. Recently a team of experts from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology visited the project and suggested that the implementation of the project must be done through a force account system,” he explained. When the project is completed the college will have the capacity to accommodate 1,500 students - 900 of them studying long courses and 600 students studying short courses.
