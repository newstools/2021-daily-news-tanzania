Chris Mugalu’s penalty kick in the second half at the Pentecost Martyrs Stadium, Kinshasa on Friday night gave Simba SC a 1-0 win against AS Vita Club in their Caf Champions League encounter. Simba is at the top of Group A, followed by Al Ahly and El-Merreikh who have not played yet while AS Vita Club is at the bottom of the table. The hosts started the match on a high, pushing for an opening goal from the wings. According to the Goal.com, in the fourth minute, hosts won a free-kick in a good area when Simba’s skipper, Mohamed Hussein, handled the ball, but Ivorian Pascal Wawa cleared the danger.
