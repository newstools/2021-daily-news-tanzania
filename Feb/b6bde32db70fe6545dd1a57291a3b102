The RAS was on his way to Dodoma for an official visit, according to the Arusha Regional Commissioner (RC) Iddi Kimanta. “It is with deep regret that I announce the death of our RAS that occurred this afternoon,” explained RC Kimanta yesterday evening. Mr Kwitega was pronounced dead upon arriving at Magugu Health Centre, according to the Regional Commissioner. “The Manyara Regional Commissioner, Joseph Mkirikiti and the regional medical officer were there to assist him, but to no avail,” said the visibly shaken regional boss while briefing reporters late evening. He further appealed for calm among Arusha residents, saying plans were underway to have the deceased body transported to Arusha.
