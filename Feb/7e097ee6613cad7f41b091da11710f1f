IN the last general election many women contested for special seats instead of constituencies because of a patriarchy in political parties, Zanzibar Women with Disabilities Association (Juwauza) has said in its report. Presenting the report to stakeholders, Juwauza chairlady Salma Saadat said they had observed that there was little women participation to patriarchy in political parties. "We need to change our views on women in leadership roles. We, women, have proved to be better leaders. Political parties should ensure equal treatment of candidates in nomination," the chairperson said. She said many women were either afraid or decided to withdraw and focus on contesting for special seats as the only chance to get into politics because political nomination for constituencies was not easy. The report also highlights lack of a friendly environment, especially for people with disabilities in follow-ups and monitoring of election campaign due to lack of sign language interpreters. "The environment was not good even for persons with albinism," Ms Saadat said as she also expressed dismay at security forces for not recognising IDs issued by the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC). She said people with disabilities or with special needs were given special IDs during the electoral process, but security officers did not recognise the IDs, a situation that limited their right to vote. Commenting on voter education provided by ZEC, she said according to their report voter education did not reach the majority of beneficiaries, including persons with disabilities and advised ZEC to put in place a mechanism that would involve civil society organisations to ensure voter education reached the majority. Despite the challenges, Juwauza says that the entire electoral process met accepted standards, thus justifying the legality of the current government. The association further advises the authorities to address challenges that emerged in the 2020 general election.
