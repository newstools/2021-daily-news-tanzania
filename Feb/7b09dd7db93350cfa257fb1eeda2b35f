ANY time beginning on Tuesday, the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), will begin reducing the amount of water at the Mtera dam, following the ongoing rains. In the expected situation, the State owned utility firm asked people neighbouring the dam to take all precautionary measures during the exercise. According to Mtera Dam Station Engineer, Elias Mwalupilo, as of February 19th this year, the  water level had reached 698.45 metres, meaning there were about five centimeters remaining to reach at the freeboard level of 698.50. Freeboard is the vertical distance from the normal water surface to the top of the confining wall. According to Eng Mwalupilo, when water goes above the highest level, efficiency of the machines to pump electricity goes down. Therefore, engineers are forced to reduce the amount of it in a bid to increase efficiency of the machines. Water that is reduced, he noted goes to Kidatu dam, which is almost full as well. In any case if the Kidatu dam is full, Eng Mwalupilo said, extra water goes to the Julius Nyerere Hydropower dam. Addressing journalists at the Mtera dam site, TANESCO Public Relations Manager, Johari Kachwamba, asked residents surrounding the area, most of whom are farmers, pastoralists and fishers to take all precautionary measures on the effects that were likely to happen. “TANESCO will continue providing massive education to area residents in collaboration with local leaders, authorities in the Rufiji Basin Development Authority and fisheries officers so that villagers engaging themselves in different economic activities take all precautionary measures, noted Ms Kachwamba.
