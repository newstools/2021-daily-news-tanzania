POLICE in Kagera Region are investigating an incident where a 38-year old man allegedly killed his biological mother from an instruction of a witchdoctor, if he wanted to be rich enough. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi named the suspect as Fredius Kibengo, a businessman at Omurushaka Trading Centre, in Karagwe district. "Initial investigations revealed that the suspect (Kibengo) visited a witchdoctor at Muyinga town in Burundi, who instructed him to bring the blood of his biological mother, so he could give him herbal concoction to make him become rich quickly. "On his return, Kibengo told his wife (name withheld) the whole scene, but she opposed that and instead fled fearing for her life,” he said. Mr Malimi named the deceased as Lonsia Philbert (61), who was murdered on the night of  February 18th, this year, while sleeping at her home village, Kibogozi, in Karagwe District. The RPC said the suspect had already been arrested and he would be arraigned when investigations were completed. However, he strongly warned people to avoid engaging in superstitious belief and instead, they should work hard to earn a decent living.
