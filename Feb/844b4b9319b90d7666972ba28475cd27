THE Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) has urged entrepreneurs possessing certificates and licences for using a quality standard mark to be good ambassadors to others by producing high quality goods which can compete in both domestic and international markets. This was said by TBS Director-General, Dr Yusuf Ngenya, during the handover of certificates and licences to producers whose products had met TBS quality standards. Some of the manufacturers who obtained certificates and licences include those engaged in producing food products, cosmetics, lubricants, sanitisers, electronic equipment and packaging materials. He said the certificates and licences would enable them to penetrate and compete in both local and global markets. “The certificates and licences handed over to them will allow them to export their products and compete in East African and international markets,” he noted. Dr Ngenya urged all entrepreneurs in the country to utilise TBS opportunities of certifying their products freely, costs funded by the government. He said to date TBS had used over 550m/- in three years for certifying entrepreneurs’ goods free of charge. He said the standard watchdog has been nurturing entrepreneurs who certify their products for seven years by making very little contributions until when they are able to pay fully charges. He said after three years, entrepreneurs were obliged to pay 25 per cent of the costs of certifying the goods. However, when TBS finds that some of them are still  unable to pay, they will continue supporting them. For his part, TBS Quality Control Director Lazaro Msasalaga said TBS had continued issuing quality standard certificates and licences. He urged them to exchange information particularly when they encountered challenges and reported TBS for addressing them.
