OVER 200 top leaders from public and private organisations are set to convene in Dar es Salaam with the aim of looking into ways of harnessing female talents in organisations. The ‘Women in Leadership’ Conference, organised by the Association of Tanzania Employers (ATE), is expected to spur commitment and action for the inclusion of women in top leadership positions and on boards. ATE Executive Director, Dr Aggrey Mlimuka, said that the workshop, which is scheduled to take place next month, will be attended by top government officials, diplomats, the business community, as well as think tanks, noting: “They will come together to showcase the vibrant and diverse approaches in mainstreaming gender at their workplaces.” In collaboration with the Confederation of the Norwegian Enterprise (NHO), ATE has been implementing various strategies to ensure there is an increase of numbers of women in senior leadership positions in the country through the association’s Female Future Programme. “With the support from our various stakeholders, Annual Leadership Conference 2021 will bring together the private sector, development partners, institutions of higher learning and the government and develop new and innovative approaches for mainstreaming gender at the workplace,” he pointed out. Mr Mlimuka said by hosting the conference, ATE and NHO will have an opportunity that enables companies and businesses to grow by strengthening women’s participation in the private sector by creating a conducive environment that unlocks gender participation in the world of work. “The conference will be the awarding ceremony of the 4th, 5th and 6th graduates of the Female Future Programme to be led by the Guest of Honour, the Vice- President Samia Suluhu Hassan,” he added. The Female Future programme, an initiative by ATE in partnership with NHO which was launched by the Vice-President in 2016 is still the most relevant and successful programme that has been shaping women from different industries within middle management to be able to take up top positions and seats in various boards.
