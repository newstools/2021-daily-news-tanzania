The former Cameroon international and Liverpool centre-back, Joel Matip will miss the rest of the season with an ankle ligament injury during the 3-1 win over Tottenham last Thursday. Manager Jurgen Klopp said: "He'll be ready for the start of the next pre-season and everything will be sorted." He joins Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez on the sidelines, although the Reds bolstered their defence by signing Ben Davies and Ozan Kabak on deadline day of transfer.
