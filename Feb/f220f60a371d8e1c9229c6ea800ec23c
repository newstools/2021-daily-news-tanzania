BABATI District Commissioner (DC) Lazaro Twange has called on development stakeholders to ensure projects are completed on time to save money and other resources. Mr Twange said this during the launch of a water project worth 400m/- supported by Coca-Cola and People Postcode Foundation (PPF) and will be implemented by WaterAid at Sangara Village in Babati District Council. He said it was pertinent that the projects, particularly this one, were completed on time to realise value for money because when they took too long to finish they cost more than the value said before. The government has been increasing water budgets year by year because of increased populations in different areas while water sources are reduced from time to time. It aims at ensuring that all people get quality water services at a fair distance. He called upon the stakeholders to look beyond Sangara village, saying that there are many villages that badly need the water services. WaterAid Country Director Anna Mzinga said the project, whose implementation started in January this year, was expected to be completed in June and serve 2,500 beneficiaries. “The purpose of this project is to ensure access to clean and safe water. Our vision as WaterAid is to see everybody using clean and safe water throughout the year,” she said, adding that they would ensure even in the dry season people accessed clean and safe water.
