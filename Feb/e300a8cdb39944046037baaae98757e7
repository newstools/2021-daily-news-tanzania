TRADERS and consumers in northern regions are set to benefit from the introduction of the new Guinness Smooth. The initiative will be an opportunity for distributors and bars in Moshi, Arusha, Manyara and Tanga towns to attract new customers and generate more revenue. Serengeti Breweries Limited (SBL) Innovation Manager Bertha Vedastus said in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday that the latest addition to the Guinness family has a distinctly smooth and refreshing taste, with the perfect balance of flavours. The new tipple has all the refreshment hallmarks of a stout, with the fine character of Guinness. “Crafted with Tanzanian consumers in mind, Guinness Smooth is a new expression of Guinness developed by Guinness master brewers, local and international, to deliver an exciting and stand-out beer that is perfect for casual social occasions. This smooth beer is produced in our Moshi brewery,” Bertha said. The trade launches held in the two cities, invited key distributors and restaurant and bar owners to be among the first people to experience and sample the new Guinness Smooth’s distinctive, rich flavours and refreshing taste. Further, she said the Guinness family in Tanzania was proud to bring a unique and world-class beer to the residents of Moshi, Arusha, Manyara and Tanga, giving them an opportunity to saviour Guinness Smooth, after being successfully launched in Dar es Salaam end of last year. “The new Guinness Smooth continues to reaffirm our commitment to bringing consumers flavourful beers they can enjoy at more occasions and that are why we have now knocked doors in northern zone.
