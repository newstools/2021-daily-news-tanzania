THE Ministry of Agriculture has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Service (JKT) to cooperate and transform the agricultural sector and attain commercial farming targets. The MoU was signed by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture Gerald Kusaya and JKT Chief Executive Maj-Gen Charles Mbuge in Dodoma on Saturday. Mr Kusaya said under the arrangement, they would jointly conduct agricultural research so that JKT attained commercial farming goals. Moreover, they will see how JKT can be an agricultural technology transfer hub to benefit surrounding national service camps. The projects under the agreement will be supervised by the implementation committee and will also cater for initiation of demonstration plots for learning and working on changing agricultural technological patterns. To address soil testing for intermediate intervention, Mr Kusaya pledged to cooperate with JKT to help it implement its plan to set up three modern agricultural laboratories. Mr Kusaya also named other areas under the MoU as engaging JKT to use the best technology in its strategic commercial farming so that the contribution of the agricultural sector to the national economy could increase. JKT is set to improve its irrigation infrastructures so that it becomes more productive and meet market demand both nationally and internationally. On value addition he said it was among the things that would be covered. For his part, Maj-Gen Mbuge said they had decided to engage in the deal so that the youth enrolled in JKT after completion of their service terms had requisite knowledge and skills and transfer it to their community. He said they wanted to increase production and engage JKT in its strategic commercial farming through its own sources. However, he asked for government support the construction of storage facilities at all JKT camps.
