POLICE in Kagera Region have gunned down three suspected heavily armed bandits for allegedly terrorising and robbing passengers along Biharamulo—Kigoma road. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi said the incident happened on Tuesday morning around 5 am at Ntumagu village, in Biharamulo District. He said police on patrol were tipped by a Good Samaritan and immediately zoomed to the scene, where they encountered seven heavily armed bandits and thereafter gun battle ensued killing three of them instantly and others escaped. “Upon being searched, they were found aged between 35-40 years and in possession of one A.K.47 with a magazine containing 18 rounds of ammunitions, three bombs, two machetes, a hunting torch and a pot full of ugali. “The bandits were preparing to stage armed robbery along the BiharamuloKigoma road. However, we appeal to the public to cooperate with police in identifying strangers and report them to nearest police station,” he said. Meanwhile, the Bukoba Catholic diocese is implementing an economic empowerment programme that aims at empowering the local community groups to run sustaining businesses. Chairman of the Bukoba Catholic Diocese Lay Community Council (Hawaka), Mr Saulo Malauri told the “Daily News” in an interview that the economic empowerment programme would be conducted in the 45 Parishes in Bukoba Diocese. “Economic empowerment is important for Catholic Community Groups. The transformation is a participatory programme for local people, priests and those in the diaspora. “Here, community groups are being sensitised on strategic planning skills and how to start and run projects to avoid the dependency syndrome,” he pointed out. Mr Malauri further said the Bukoba Catholic Diocese celebrated its centenary in 1997 as a reminder that notable achievements have been recorded in various sectors including health, education and social services.
