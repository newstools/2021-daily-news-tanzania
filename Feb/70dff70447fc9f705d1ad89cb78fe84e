I N the coming week, we still prospect that the market will remain vibrant going forward specifically on the banking sector and Cement sector. We have witnessed share price movement in the local counters which amplifies that there is demand in the market that will drive market activities during the week. The market will remain active during the week and mainly from the top local active counters. CRDB Plc share price anticipated to decline at the bourse, despite having strong fundamentals for Buy recommendation. The reason behind is the Cost to income ratio which the bank has not met and will not be able to pay dividend. For investors looking for income is likely to exit this counter and this will drive the price down. Other top counters expected to transact during the week include TBL, JATU, TPCC, NICOL, SWIS and DSE. In midweek we expect a Treasury bill auction to be held by the central bank. There could be slight increase in the WAY with low volatility towards decline in yields for the short-term instruments, but with a likelihood of oversubscription subject to yield increase. Yields on treasuries will continue to increase but a slight basis point. In the interbank cash market, despite the increase in the Weighted average rate (WAR) during the previous week, we still reiterate anticipate that WAR will continue to be stable and within a range of 3.50 per cent to 4.00 per cent with slight volatility in the high and low rate.
