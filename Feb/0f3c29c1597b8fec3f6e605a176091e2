POLICE in Kagera Region are on alert following reports from a neighbouring country that a joint security operation had been mounted to crack down on a counterfeit dollar racket. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi appealed to residents to report to nearest police stations if they came across suspected dealers in counterfeit dollars. “The gang mostly targets unsuspecting residents at local markets (mijajaro). However, nobody has been arrested so far in connection with obtaining money by false pretences, uttering false documents and dealing in counterfeits,” he added. Kagera Region shares borders with three East African countries namely Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda while Kenya can also be reached through Lake Victoria.
