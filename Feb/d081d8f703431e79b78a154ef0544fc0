CONTRACTORS Registration Board (CRB) has sensitised contractors in the country on the use of Tanzanian National e-Procurement System (TANePS) when they apply for construction tenders. This was said at the weekend by CRB Registrar Rhoben Nkori when closing a three-day training seminar organised by the board for local contractors. The training seminar was all about contract management, TANePS, cost control, quality control, insurance and securities, time control and the role of parties to the contract. “Currently you can’t get any tender without using TANePS. So, it is very important for you to understand the system because it is compulsory. That is why it was important to conduct this training so that you may be able to master the system and use it,” he said. He told local contractors to peruse their contracts before they signed them to avoid frictions with their clients during project implementation. For their part, contractors commended CRB for training because it added value to their daily operations and urged the board to continue with the spirit to help local contractors grow. Ms Filomena Malenda from Progressive Women Contractors Limited said the threeday training workshop was an eye opener in many issues, including contract management and now she could be able to use TANePS when they applied for tenders. Mr Idrisa Kinyagu also congratulated CRB on training, saying it had helped him to know many things as he was not aware of how to apply for tenders using the Tanzanian National e-Procurement System. “This training is of profound importance because we were not aware of many things, but now we are and this will improve service delivery,” he said.
