ALBINISM Awareness Foundation (AAF) has called upon the public and well-wishers to support financing people living with albinism so that they acquire health insurance cards. AAF Director, Mr Suleiman Magoma said people living with albinism are in high demand of medical attention, thus having a health insurance cover will help them in treatment, wherever the need arises. He made the appeal here on Wednesday when the foundation was handing over a National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) card to Mr Japhet Manyika, their beneficiary in an economic empowerment project. He further said it was important for people with albinism to secure health insurance support, especially those with low economic status. Mr Magoma said December last year, they started a programme to raise funds for the health insurance cover for Mr Manyika, who is suffering from sight cancer, clinically known as Retinoblastoma. Elaborating, he said, there are many people with albinism, who are in need of the same health insurance cover support, hence appealed to the public to support. AAF in the society aims at creating awareness and addressing socio-economic issues pertaining to albinism and creating public awareness on the rights of people living with albinism. He said they also support the economic empowerment of people living with albinism through skills training and establishing economic projects. Magoma also expressed their commitment to protecting people living with albinism from contracting skin cancer by providing them with sunscreen lotions, hats with brims, and paying for their skin clinics as well as protective gears like monocular and glasses.
