AUTHORITIES in Kagera Region have warned residents to avoid eating dead fish found on Lake Victoria, as this could pose health risks. Kagera Regional Fisheries Officer Efrazi Mkama told ‘Daily News’ that they were closely following up reports from a neighbouring country, showing that some dead fish species had been washed up ashore on Lake Victoria, as well as Lake Kyoga and The Nile. “We have taken necessary precautions. Preliminary investigations show fish poisoning. So, people are warned to avoid eating dead fish if they see them floating, instead they have to bury,” he said. Elaborating, Mr Mkama said last month dead fish stocks, locally known as ‘kifelezi’ were spotted floating on Bugabo and Nyabesigwa sites, adding that the cause might be a drop in oxygen levels. Nile Perch, which can grow to maturity and weigh more than 100kg, is believed to be sensitive to oxygen levels below two milligrams per litre of water. Lake Victoria is a vital resource shared by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Officials blame overfishing and pollution for severely damaging fish stocks. The East African Community (EAC) has designated the lake basin as an ‘economic growth zone’, with the potential to develop into a major economic region. Fishing is vital in creating employment opportunities, mostly ruralbased, thereby helping to reduce rural-urban migration. Fish is also a rich source of animal protein for human consumption and provides raw materials for processing animal feeds. Based on current stock estimates, the lake has the potential to yield fish valued at over $800m annually on a sustainable basis.
