THE Confederation of African Football (CAF) has decided that both first and second leg of the Caf Confederation Cup matches involving Namungo FC and CD Primeiro de Agosto should be played in Tanzania within 72 hours. Caf’s Competition Committee concluded that the two legs should be played in Dar es Salaam after realizing that both teams were not directly involved in the cancelation of the first leg encounter in Luanda on 14th February, 2021. The committee has directed the two legs to be played within three days, equivalent to 72 hours, by February, this year. According to the schedule, CD Agosto will be the hosts of the first leg and Namungo FC will not be responsible for its preparations and match officials. Qualified clubs for the group stages are expected to be drawn on 22nd February, 2021 hence a winner between Angola giant and Namungo FC will be grouped without considering ranking of a respective club.
