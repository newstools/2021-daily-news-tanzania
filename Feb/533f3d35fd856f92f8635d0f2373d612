At least three people were killed and eight others injured after a car bomb detonated near a security checkpoint along a key road in Mogadishu on Saturday, officials have confirmed. CGTN quoted a police officer at the scene as saying, the suicide bomber tried to force his car laden with explosives through a checkpoint near Sayidka junction in the vicinity of the Somali presidential palace, sparking a gunfight with security forces. "Security forces at the checkpoint fired at the speedy car and then (the car bomb) exploded," the officer was quoted by CGTN.
