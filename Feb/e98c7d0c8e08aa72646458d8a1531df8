OVER 2.9bn/- has been collected from the Mining sector in Simiyu Region in a period of six months from July 2020 to January this year, it has been learnt. The area Regional Mining Officer, Mr Joseph Kumburu made the revelation over the weekend during some small-scale miners’ meeting in Dutwa Ward in Bariadi District. He further said the amount was raised as a result of strong supervision of Gold Fund in the area, adding: “We are continuing to do our best because, for instance, this February is not yet over but already 430m/- has been collected. There will be over 3bn/- collected by end of the month and that is above our 600m/- to 700bn/- target per month.” However, the area Regional Small Miners’ Association  (SIMIREMA) Chairman, Mr Paul Matendele, said a lot could still be collected, but because of ignorance of many artisans on the mining laws the collection will still dwindle. “There are some unnecessary conflicts with some small miners and this affects operations and revenue collections in some mining sites,” he said. To fight such a challenge, Mr Matendele said the small scale miners as well as the public require constant education. He also urged the miners to present their claims to SIMIREMA and not anywhere else, saying the association exists legally for them. “I would like to inform you that presenting your claims to any other authority for the sake of it is not proper, we have SIMIREMA that is a relevant body to address our challenges,” he pointed out. Equally, he urged the relevant ministry of minerals to continue issuing the mining licences in time and set up special mining sites for small scale miners to be trained and as well use their group to solve their problems.
