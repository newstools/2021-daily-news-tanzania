Directors at the development lender had signed off last year on USD800 million of funding for free primary schooling, a flagship project of President Felix Tshisekedi. But in a report published in November, the DRC's Inspector General of Finances "revealed a number of shortcomings and alleged cases of fraud and corruption in connection with the use of public funds in the sector, as well as weaknesses in internal controls," the World Bank said in a statement. "The disbursement scheduled for December is currently on hold, while the World Bank similarly exercises its own fiduciary responsibility," the institution added, saying it was "working closely with the Congolese authorities".
