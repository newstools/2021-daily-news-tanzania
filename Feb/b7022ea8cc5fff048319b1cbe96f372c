TANZANIA Tourist Board (TTB) has unveiled a plan to enhance the participation of women in tourism and recreational activities in the country. TTB Managing Director Ms Devota Mdachi said in Dar es Salaam that the plans will involve exposing around 600 women to opportunities available in the tourism sector and related recreational activities. “The Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, through TTB, has decided to celebrate this year’s International Women’s Day in style. We will take 600 business women in Arusha, Mwanza and Dar es Salaam to visit tourists’ attractions; this will expose them to opportunities and ways of grabbing them.” She said that in Arusha women traders will tour Tarangire national park, in Mwanza they will visit Saanane Island National Park and in Dar es Salaam the tour will involve Saadani National Park at the shores of the Indian Ocean. She said that other activities will involve exhibition of products demanded in tourism and recreational activities, which aims at increasing a number of women owning and running businesses related to tourism in the country. Tanzania Business Women Association (TABWA) will partner with TTB in a series of events which will climax on March 8, the date marked for International Women’s Day. “Most of the women in the tourism sector are employed at lower level posts; we want them to be aggressive in the sector and to strive to compete for leadership positions for those employed,” said Ms Noreen Mawala, TABWA Executive Director. She said among areas of special emphasis will include trading in food and beverages, costumes, tourists transportation and logistics among others. The theme for this year is ‘Come Celebrate Women’s Day with Women in Tourism’. The guest of honour will be Deputy Minister of Tourism and Natural Resources Ms Mary F. Masanja.
