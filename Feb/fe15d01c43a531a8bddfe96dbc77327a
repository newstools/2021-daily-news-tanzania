NMB Bank Plc has donated 950 iron sheets to six schools in Babati District, Manyara Region, to help the government address a shortage of classrooms. The handover event was graced by Manyara Regional Commissioner, Joseph Mkirikiti at Galapo Secondary School in Babati District. Speaking at the event, NMB Bank Central Zone Manager Nsolo Mlozi said the donation aimed at supporting the government to increase the number of classrooms to cater for a high number of schoolchildren. “The donation aims at supporting the government to ensure all pupils who pass Standard Seven exams get classrooms and study in an enabling environment,” he said. Mlozi added that the iron sheets donated to six schools in Babati District were worth 28.1m/-. The schools that benefitted from the donation are Magugu, Galapo, Madunga, Nar, Qash and Aytesea. He said NMB Bank had been contributing to the community as part of its corporate social responsibility to give back some of the profit to society. He said the bank’s support had been directed towards key sectors in the community namely health, education and in case of disasters. For his part, Babati Council Director John Nchimbi thanked NMB Bank for support, while insisting that the financial institution had been the saviour of poor people. Mr Nchimbi said about 503 pupils joined Form One this year after passing well their Standard Seven examinations, but lack of classrooms denied them an opportunity to pursue their secondary school studies. But with the bank’s donation, they are able to solve the problem of 13 classrooms and from next week they will start their studies. For his part, Manyara Regional Commissioner Joseph Mkirikiti directed school committees to ensure classroom projects were implemented with high standards.
