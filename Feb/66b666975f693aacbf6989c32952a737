Speaking at the weekend when SIDO organised a seminar for parliamentarians on SIDO performance, success and a way forward, Committee Deputy Chairman Erick Shigongo said they should help entrepreneurs to use best technologies so that the industries could be set up and thrive well during this digital world. Mr Shigongo said SIDO should   come out with a different outfit on research and facilitate innovations that met standards and market demand. “You must involve the youth who are innovative and help them sharpen their knowledge and skills and utilise technologies for social transformation." Responding, Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade Exaud Kigahe said the government was committed to supporting SIDO to put in place the best and modern equipment for vibrant industries. He said SIDO was well-planned to reach out to districts and people especially in rural areas. Moreover, he said, they wanted to mobilise entrepreneurs to set up small and medium industries for increased employment opportunities and economic development. The deputy minister said they wanted to start awarding young innovators so that they could improve their innovations. Mr Kigahe said SIDO was going on with the construction of industrial shades in every region where the entrepreneurs could set up small and medium industries. "This will directly show the contribution of SIDO to the country," he noted. For his part, SIDO Chief Executive Officer, Prof Sylivester Mpanduji, said they provided services, including developing technologies, especially those related to setting up processing industries.
