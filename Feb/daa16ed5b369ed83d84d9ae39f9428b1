Speaking while winding up the exercise in Dar es Salaam, the Kilimanjaro Marathon Company representative Rajon Datoo said the exercise ran smoothly and that the number of those who collected their race numbers was encouraging. “We received a lot of cooperation from the participants hence the exercise moved faster and we were able to serve many participants,” he said adding that those who were not able to collect their numbers in Dar es Salaam can do so in Arusha or Moshi. “We are calling on all participants for the Kilimanjaro Premium Lager 42 km, Tigo 21km Half Marathon and Grand Malt 5km-Fun Run who indicated that they will collect their points in Arusha to turn up tomorrow and Wednesday from 2pm to 7pm  at the Kibo Palace Hotel in Arusha,” he said.
