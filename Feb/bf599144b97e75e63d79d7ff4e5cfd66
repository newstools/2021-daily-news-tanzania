PLANS are underway to look for an investor to revive Kidabaga Tea factory in Kilolo District, Iringa Region, the Ministry of Industry and Trade has said. The ministry is also preparing a circular on all factories that were repossessed by the government after remaining dormant for a long time. The deputy minister of the portfolio, Mr Exaud Kigahe told Parliament that the government was aware of the importance of the revival of the tea factory in Kilolo. “Plans include the finalisation of a proposal on the structure of the factory and the modality of operations that will promote the interests of tea farmers and the country at large,” he said. He added: “The ministry remains committed to ensuring the factory gets a proper investor who will protect and put forward the interests of the country and farmers.” He was of the view that the revival of the factory, apart from creating employment, would also guarantee a reliable market for tea farmers in surrounding areas and contribute to national development. The deputy minister was responding to a question of Kilolo MP Justine Nyamoga, who wanted to know when the government would finalise the process of getting an investor for Kidabaga Factory. In another development, Deputy Minister for Water Maryprisca Mahundi said the construction of a water project in Njombe Town Council would commence in April this year. She said the project would be implemented using $500m, which was a soft loan from Exim Bank of India to be spent on water projects in 28 councils of Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. “The projects will be implemented in 24 months. The implementation of the project is in line with the government’s efforts to end shortages of water in the country and improve service delivery,” she said as she was responding to a question by Njombe Town MP Deodatus Mwanyika.
