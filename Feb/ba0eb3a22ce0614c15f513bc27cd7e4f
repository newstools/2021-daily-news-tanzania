PAKISTAN has expressed its commitment to continuing strengthening bilateral relations with Tanzania, including promoting tourist attractions in the largest East African nation. The commitment was expressed recently in Dar es Salaam by High Commissioner Extraordinary & Plenipotentiary for Pakistan Muhammad Saleem, when he was speaking on the journey of a young Pakistani who visited Tanzania for scaling up Mt Kilimanjaro. He said Pakistan and Tanzania had been enjoying friendly relations and mutual cooperation, insisting that his country would strengthen ties for the benefits of the two countries. Mr Saleem said  the Pakistani High Commission in the country would continue promoting the country's tourist attractions, including  strengthening cooperation in trade, industry, agriculture, culture, sports etc. Speaking on tourism Mr Saleem said Mt Kilimanjaro stood out to be one of the best country’s tourist attractions, a factor that prompted 23-year-old Pakistani Asad Ali Memon to come to Tanzania to climb Africa’s highest peak. “We have been promoting Tanzania a lot especially Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, Mafia, Mt Kilimanjaro, Ngorongoro Crater, Serengeti and Zanzibar,” said Mr Saleem. He said Mr Memon scaled up Mt Kilimanjaro peak on Umbwe Route in 24 hours on February 15, 2021. He added that Mr Memon was the first Pakistani and Asian professional mountaineer, who was excited to trek the highest peak in East Africa and return to the base camp in one day. “Mr Memon is not only the first ever Pakistani professional mountaineer, but also the first Asian, who is excited to scale up the highest peak in Africa and return to the base camp in one day,” said Mr Saleem. “His visit will contribute to the High Commission’s ongoing efforts to promote adventure tourism, trekking, hiking, professional mountaineering, people-to-people contacts and cultural ties between the two friendly countries,” said Mr Saleem.
