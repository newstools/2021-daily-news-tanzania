Barcelona are planning to keep out midfielder Phillipe Coutinho for the rest of the season to avoid more than € 5 million (£ 4.3m) in compensation for Liverpool if they use him in the next five games. It has been reported by ‘The Dailystar’ website that Barcelona are owed € 29m with an extra € 5m left over from the € 162m signing of the 2018 season from Liverpool. The network's correspondent, Javier Miguel, who raised conflict between Lionel Messi and former assistant coach Eder Sarabia, Messi and Barcelona, said Barcelona are unwilling to pay the amount. The club's priority is to save money at the moment. "Barca have to pay € 5m in five games and it will not happen," said Miguel.
