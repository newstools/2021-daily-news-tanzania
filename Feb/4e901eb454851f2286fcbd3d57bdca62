NAMUNGO FC head coach, Hemed Morocco has said that he will work hard to improve his side to be ready to face continental giants should they sail through to the group stage of CAF Confederation Cup. Should Namungo qualify, they will play in Group D of the group stage alongside Moroccan heavyweights Raja Casablanca, Pyramids FC of Egypt, and Zambia’s Nkana FC with the top two teams making it to the quarter-finals. He said that despite beating Primeiro Agosto of Angola 6-2 in the CAF Confederation Cup play off, his boys still made some mistakes that resulted in their opponents being awarded penalties. “I know things will be even tough when we will face giant sides at the group stage, we therefore need to be well prepared,” he was quoted as saying. He said that despite having an advantage of their huge first leg comfortable victory, the job is not yet over for Namungo though they need just a draw or any margin to be assured of a ticket to reach the group stage. Namungo are making their maiden appearance in the continental club tournament and have proved to be serious competitors in their preliminary matches. Though it may be seen as an impossible dream for Agosto to turn things around, football results have always been unpredictable. And with that reasons, Morocco has said that his boys have not yet concluded their business until they count on ‘hatched eggs’ tomorrow after the end of the return leg. Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) information officer, Clifford Ndimbo said the return leg tie will be held tomorrow.
