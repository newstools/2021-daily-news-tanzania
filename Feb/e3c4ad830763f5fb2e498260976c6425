NORTH Mara Gold Mine has handed over 2bn/- service levy to Tarime District Council in Mara Region. The service levy is for a period between July and December last year, according to the goldmine's management. North Mara Gold Mine General Manager (GM) Luiz Correria handed over a dummy cheque of the service levy to Tarime District leaders at an event held at Nyamwaga headquarters of Tarime District Douncil on Thursday last week. The GM expressed optimism that the service levy would help boost social and economic development in the district council, which hosts the goldmine. “We are proud of handing over the service levy today and hopefully we will continue doing so,” the GM, who was accompanied by Gold Mine Community Relations Manager Gilbert Mworia said. The goldmine is now operated by Barrick Gold Corporation in partnership with the government of Tanzania through Twiga Minerals Corporation. Speaking after receiving the dummy cheque, Tarime District Commissioner (DC) Mtemi Msafiri instructed the district council to ensure the money was well spent to improve social services in education, health and water. “Tarime is developing very fast in terms of development and we want every ward secondary school to have a hostel,” Mr Msafiri said. Besides having many secondary schools, some of them high schools, Tarime District plans to have a special secondary school for girls, according to the DC. Tarime District Council Executive Director (DED) Apoo Castro Tindwa thanked the goldmine for cooperation that has greatly helped to improve social services in the area. “I am impressed with the cooperation we are getting from Barrick. For example, we now have eight health centres,” Mr Tindwa said. Apart from the service levy, the goldmine also supports community development projects through corporate social responsibility in neighbouring villages.
