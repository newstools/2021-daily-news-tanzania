THE government has reminded newly registered pharmacists to adhere to professional ethics and integrity to win public trust in their workplace. The call was made by Pharmacy Council of Tanzania (PCT) Board Registrar Elizabeth Shekalaghe during a ceremony to admit and register 252 new pharmacists held in the country’s capital city. Ms Shekalaghe equally warned unethical pharmacists, insisting that the board would not hesitate to take appropriate legal action against any culprit. “The council will neither fear nor favour any pharmacist, who will act contrary to the code of conduct and we will not hesitate to de-register whoever will contravene the code,’’ she insisted. Ms Shekalaghe said the council was currently enforcing new regulations released in 2020, adding that as registrar, she was duty-bound not to defend those, who were going against the code of conduct, but enforce the law. At least 252 new pharmacists were certified by the Pharmacy Council during the ceremony attended by various officials from the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, including Deputy Minister, Dr Godwin Mollel. Speaking on the occasion, Dr Mollel said the government was really counting on pharmacists in the country as they had an opportunity to help Tanzanians in health issues. “Do not end up dispensing drugs to patients, you should know that you are equally duty-bound to ensure that there is no medicine that is misappropriated at your workstations,’’ said Dr Mollel, directing that pharmacists should be volunteering routine information of the value chain for drugs. He advised them to be patriotic and ethical because their profession was very important for people’s lives. He further tasked them to be innovative by conducting various studies that could help Tanzanians have enough medicines treating various diseases through clinical trials.
