KAGERA region has spent more than 120bn/- in the past five years in the education sector to improve infrastructures including construction of classrooms, teachers' houses and desks’ purchase. This was said by Kagera Regional Commissioner (RC), Brigadier General Marco Gaguti, while receiving 100 chairs and same number of tables donated to them by TIB Development Bank to Secondary Schools in Missenyi District Council. The RC noted the region used the funds to also increase students’ enrolment following the government's strategy of providing free education that has seen a number of students turning up for studies. According to Brigadier General Gaguti more than 57bn/- has been spent on the infrastructure including building schools, teachers' houses, toilets and desks’ purchase for students. “The remaining 63bn/- has been spent to free education and that has ultimately contributed in wooing students to turn up for studies in the region. This is a blessing and a blessing because if you want to redeem a poor child give him education,” he said. He equally, thanked the bank for the support saying it will motivate students to study hard, saying: “However, I called upon teachers and students to safeguard the desks.” On his part, TIB Development Bank, Lake Zone Manager, Mr Emmanuel Bushiri  said that they reached the Education sector as one of the important sectors in the country's development. “We believe this support will contribute in the government's goal of continuing to improve free education, so that it can provide adequate knowledge and skills to our children. “TIB Development Bank will continue to support the government's commitment, especially through the speech of President John Magufuli, during the inauguration of the 12th Parliament in Dodoma, on November 13th, 2020 ,” Mr Bushiri said.
