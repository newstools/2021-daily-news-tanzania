SPEAKER of the National Assembly Job Ndugai has banned all MPs from using the logo of Parliament in private communications. He said those, who were using it in their private documents were committing criminal offences, as the law, rules and regulations provided that the logo should be used in documents from the Speaker or other officials of Parliament. Mr Ndugai made the announcement in Parliament after the end of question and answer session, saying there were some MPs, who were still using it in their private communications and announcement. "I had already instructed all MPs to stop using it in your private communications, but some of you are still using it, which is wrong," he said. "Some of the MPs have been using the logo in announcing appointments and sacking of their personal assistants. Another one has done the same while announcing scholarship opportunities for Bachelor and Masters’ degree for the residents of his constituency.” "It's only Speaker and House officials who are supposed to use this logo in documents. It's an offence for anyone who isn't involved to use it in their private communications," he insisted. He said from February 5, 2021 onwards, it had been prohibited to use the Parliament logo in all private communications of MPs," noted the Speaker. In another development, Speaker Ndugai said he had pledged to issue statistics on the age of MPs, but until yesterday, 76 lawmakers had not yet submitted their information on their age. “But so far, according to the statistics I have, there is a small number of MPs, whose age falls less than 40 years and above 50 years. The age of majority falls between 40 and 50 years.” He, therefore, noted that it would be wrong to name it as the Parliament of the youth or elders, since the age of majority of lawmakers was between 40 and 50 years old.
