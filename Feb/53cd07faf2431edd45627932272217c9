South Africa says it will on Monday reopen 20 of its land border crossings that were shut last month to try to stop the spread of Covid-19 infections. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Saturday. South Africa has been hit hard by a second wave of the outbreak linked to a new variant of the disease. It has recorded almost 1.5 million infections and more than 47,000 Covid-related deaths - by far the highest toll in Africa.
