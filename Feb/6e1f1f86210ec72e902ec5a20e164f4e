THE police in Dodoma have decided to collaborate with their colleagues in Iringa, Morogoro, Singida and Manyara regions to crack down on crime and keep Dodoma Capital City and surrounding regions safe. Dodoma Regional Police Commander Gilles Muroto said they had formed a five-region taskforce to track down on crime in the regions. Mr Muroto said an increase in robbery incidents, especially car theft that had skyrocketed in January to March last year was the main reason for the joint initiative. He said the perpetrators of crime ran from one region to another, so it was good to join forces. "We need the capital city to be a safe place for all, but we can't do it alone. We have welcomed our neighbours to help each other on tacking criminal in our areas. For example, most of the cars stolen here are driven to Arusha or Dar es Salaam. So, the police in Morogoro or Manyara will crack down on them before reaching their destinations," he enlarged. RPC Muroto also hinted that investigation revealed that criminals were collaborating with their allies from region to region so teamwork within Police Force was needed. He explained that in recent cases, the police in Dodoma had intercepted illegal immigrants before entering Iringa Region that showed the importance of collaboration between the regions. On the other hand, the police in Dodoma detained 28 suspects (most of them being young people aged 30 years) allegedly for committing different crimes in the city, including robbery, housebreaking, cybercrime and possession of drugs.
