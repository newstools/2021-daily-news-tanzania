THE government recommended on Thursday reduction in penalties imposed under the Road Safety Act Chapter 168 for Motorcycle and Bajaji offenses from the current 30,000/- to 10,000/-. Finance and Planning Minister Dr. Mwigulu Nchemba said the purpose of the new measures is to set penalties based oneâ€™s ability to pay. He said the fines for motor vehicles will remain at 30,000/-. Tabling the 2021/22 national budget, the Minister said large penalties has pushed more motor-cycles to be abandoned at the Police Stations. Dr. Nchemba said majority of Tanzania youths are employed in the transport sector using three-wheelers motor cycles (Bajaji) and BodaBoda. The law governing road safety provides a fine of 30,000/- to the operators when convicted for breach of road traffic rules.
