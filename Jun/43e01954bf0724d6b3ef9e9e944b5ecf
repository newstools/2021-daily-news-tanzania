MTWARA’S Dangote Cement Factory is planning to recycle plastic wastes and produce useful products in a bid to reduce pollution. To walk the talk, the factory, part of the Nigeria based cement firm, has donated waste collecting bins to the district council and asked residents to separate plastic from other trashes. The Mtwara Dangote General Manager (Production), Mr Abayomi Awofudu, said the bins were collected from different solid wastes and separated them from plastic that would later be taken to the factory for recycling. “This is the beginning to protect environment. Cleanliness is next to health and when you are healthy you can do anything,” Mr Awofudu noted when handing over donation of waste bins to leaders of Hiari Village in Mtwara District Council. He said that as ‘charity begins at home’, they had started with Hiari Village where the factory is located. The management of the factory has called on its environment officers to oversee the work of collecting and recycling the waste plastic as well as managing other wastes within the factory’s area. Mtwara Acting District Executive Director, Mr John Nsoko said the waste bins would help the village’s leaders and residents to keep their environment clean. “We really thank the management of Dangote for the donation which has come at the right time when the District is preparing to join others in marking the World Environment Day,” Mr Nsoko emphasized. He directed the villagers to abide-by the rules ensuring the village is kept clean by storing the waste in correct bins and placed at collecting centres in the village or will be fined. The cement factory is the largest in the country with installation capacity of producing 3.0 million tonnes a year and was commissioned in December 2015. The area has about 500 million tonnes of limestone reserves, enough for 149 years. The plant is capable of producing large amounts of high-quality 32.5 and 42.5 grade cement to meet market demands at competitive prices.
