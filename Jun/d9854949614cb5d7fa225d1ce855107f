DCB Commercial Bank has unveiled its new outlook, a component of the bank’s strategies to improve its services. “ This new outlook rhymes with changes and success that has been taking place at DCB and that are designed to align the bank on the right track towards achieving growth and delivery of superior services that are abreast with evolution of the banking market,” said DCB Managing Director, Godfrey Ndalahwa, during the launch of the outlook that went concurrently with the bank’s Annual General Meeting held in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. Ndalahwa said the new outlook was part of DCB’s five-year action plan for 2018-2022, which aimed at uplifting the bank and constantly changing it to readjust to prevailing market conditions. He said the new look aimed at empowering the bank to reach out to more Tanzanians, deliver more innovative and affordable digital products, increase investment to boost shareholder returns, strengthen the bank, and ensure the security of customer funds. Describing the bank’s new logo, he said it featured two parallel lines that reflected the fact that DCB was a commercial bank operating on sound principles, its vast experience and proof of great success gained since its inception; and a red dot symbolising the bank’s zeal be a pace-setter in the long journey towards offering digital products and reaching out to more people.
