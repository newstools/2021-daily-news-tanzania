DEPUTY Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Ms Pauline Gekulu, said the government has allocated 300m/- in 2021/22 fiscal year to Tanzania Standard Newspapers (TSN) to purchase work related vehicles. She also said through the Ministry of Finance and Planning, a total of 495m/- TSN debt has been collected and channeled to make initial preparations for the purchase of a commercial print unit. The Deputy Minister made the revelation on Monday, while winding up the 54.7bn/- budget estimates for the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, further saying the government is determined to support the state owned media to perform to the excellence. “It is true that TSN is facing a number of operation challenges such as lack of equipment including state of the art print unit, we have allocated 300m/- in our budget for them to purchase vehicles, and we shall go on with a number of strategies to make it remain strong as the government mouth piece,” she pointed out. Ms Gekulu further said the ministry of Finance and Planning is assisting in collecting debts of TSN from other ministries and public institutions, so that it becomes capable of implementing its projects. She made the remark, while responding to some questions posed by Mr Cosato Chumi (Mafinga Urban- CCM) on the status of TSN, especially the steps the government was taking to improve it. Mr Chumi was of opinion that the government should take full charge of buying the state of an art print unit, despite TSN debts being 11bn/- while the machine costs 16bn/-. In response, the Deputy Minister assured him that the ministry is working around the clock to ensure TSN stands fit for market competition and excellence.
