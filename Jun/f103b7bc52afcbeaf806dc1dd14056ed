Tigo Tanzania, has received 7,000 tree seedlings from Helios Towers Tanzania as a donation towards telco’s tree planting initiative, Tigo Green for Kili. Tigo, one of the leading telco in the country, intends to conserve the snow around Mt Kilimanjaro as it aims to plant over 28,000 trees around Kilimanjaro region. Tigo Tanzania Northern Zone Territory Manager, Daniel Mainoya said the donation by Helios Towers was bringing the total number to 31,446 tree seedlings, reflecting the success of the project. “…The trees will help restoring the snow on Mt. Kilimanjaro which has been decreasing for the past four years due to global warming, rampant cutting down of trees for firewood, illegal logging, and forest fires,” Mr Mainoya said during the handover ceremony held in Hai, Kilimanjaro. The initiative, which kicked off in late February, has received an overwhelming response from members of the public. The Helios Towers Tanzania Managing Director, Ramsey Koola said they not only connect Africa but also contributing to social and economic development in the areas they operate. “Our sustainable business strategy reflects our economic, social and environment contributions and commitments, and the value we create for all our stakeholders,” Mr Koola added
