President Samia Suluhu Hassan threatened on Tuesday to put the management of the continent’s famous market—Kariakoo under the Dar es Salaam city council. Speaking during her impromptu visit at the market, the president ordered the Minister in her office responsible for regional administration and local government, Ummy Mwalimu to suspend the current management pending investigations. It was not immediately established the reason behind the management’s dismissal. But the President said at the overly populated marketplace spanning several city blocks, she will task a special team to review and recommend on the new decision. The Market has been under the Kariakoo Market Corporations since 1974.President Samia says “My decision is that we will re-evaluate the market and determine if it should be managed by the current leadership or it should be placed under the city council.”She openly expressed her displeasure over the messy inhabited by traders. The market is currently unorganized, according to the president and other observers. It is chaos. “As you can find a tailor in the middle of an agro-pesticides store and rat poison seller,” she said adding; “the market does not look good.”Even though, the president painfully learnt that the petty traders are not getting the support from the market leaders. During her 15 minutes break at the market, the president held talks with some traders to familiarize with challenges they encounter during their daily businesses.
