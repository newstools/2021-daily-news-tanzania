THE government is committed to building 121 Health Centres and finalising 768 Dispensaries across the country in the coming financial year. To realize that, the government has set aside 27.75bn/- in this financial year to construct the health facilities countrywide. Deputy Minister in the President’s Office Regional Administration and Local Government, Dr Festo Dugange made the revelation in reply to Ms Anatropia Theonest (Special Seats-Chadema), who wanted to know the government’s plan to have a Dispensary in every ward countrywide. The minister said in response, that the government will continue to set aside funds for the construction of health centres across the country. The deputy minister said the government will also continue implementing the health policy, which stipulates that the country should have a Dispensary in every Ward. “From 2015/16 to 2020/21 the government has constructed 488 Health Centres as well as 102 District Hospitals,” the minister said. According to the minister, the programme has now enabled Health Centres in local authorities to offer emergency services from 115 in December 2015 to 352 in June 2021, a move that has reduced the maternal deaths. In an additional question, the MP asked whether the construction of a dispensary in every Ward was a government policy. Minister Ndugane said the programme will go together with employing health workers, saying that from 2017 to 2020, the State in collaboration with stakeholders employed 12,868 workers, who have been deployed to various stations in the country. He said the government was finalising the processes of employing 2,726 workers as announced in May 2021.
