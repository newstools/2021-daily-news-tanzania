MINISTER of State President's Office, Regional Administration and Local Government (PO-RALG) Ummy Mwalimu clarified on Sunday that selection procedures for students joining Form Four and Vocational training are based on own preference and performance. She tweeted that students were sorted according to their preferences (first to fifth choice), based on their performance and the criteria selected in the relevant combination. The clarification followed widely circulated reports that some students who had qualified for form four secondary education have been pushed to colleges and or schools they didn't choose. “It should be noted that no successful student with first grade has been selected to join the cadre mentioned in the news by the author,” a statement released by the ministry also said. The selection process involved requiring all students to put five options of combination for Form Five as well as college options for those who will not be selected to join Form Five. Citing a texted message, the minister said a parent complained to her after a child was selected of HGK an art combination in stead of CBG. According to the minister the review of the student's application on the system shows he placed HGK as a first selection while CBG making it a fourth option. The minister said her office was following up cases to ensure justification of students selection.
