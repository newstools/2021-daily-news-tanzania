THE Government has instructed the Workers Compensation Fund (WCF) to raise awareness on its duties and roles in order to increase the number of its members and attract investments in the country. The Minister of State, Prime Minister’s Office (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Youth, Employment and Persons with Disability), Ms Jenista Mhagama issued the directive in Dar es Salaam during the Parliamentary Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee visit to the WCF office in Dar es Salaam, yesterday. “Come out and explain on the role of the WCF so that many employers can register with you and pay their contributions,” she said, adding; “WCF will attract more investments because it deals with compensating victims of accidents at workplaces, and thus gives employers an avenue to concentrate on productive work other than taking care of health challenges employees face while on official duties,” she pointed out. Welcoming the minister, the Parliamentary Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee Vice-Chairperson, Ms Najma Giga promised that the lawmakers will put a lot of effort to ensure that WCF is widely known and attract more investors to create jobs in the country. “We are taking up the role of popularizing WCF. From now on, we shall persuade all Members of Parliament to take it seriously and speak for WCF so that it benefits the country and the entire public,” she said. Earlier, WCF Director General, Dr John Mduma told the committee that currently, 24,936 of total 28,267 employers from both public and private sectors have registered with them. He said that the WCF has already collected over 9bn/- since 2015 when it started operations. According to him, WCF was handling all matters related to injuries at workplaces by compensating employees who have been injured or died upon accidents at workplaces.
