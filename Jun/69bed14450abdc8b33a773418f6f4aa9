FORMER Hai District Commissioner, Lengai Ole Sabaya appeared before the Arusha District Court charged with six counts. Donned in a pull neck, the embattled politician and five others were charged with leading a criminal gang, armed robbery, economic sabotage, money laundering and corruption. Reading the counts, State Prosecutor Tumaini Kweka, in front of magistrate Martha Mahumbuga, alleged that former DC and his co accused committed the crimes between January 20 and February 9 this year. The prosecution told a full-packed court that Sabaya and his bodyguards, Sylivester Nyengu and Daniel Mbura committed armed robbery on February 9, after roughing up Sombetini Ward councilor Bakari Msangi and extorting 390,000/- from him. The Court further heard that the former DC had on January 20 this year solicited 90m/- worth of bribe from an Arusha based businessman, Francis Evarist Mroso to shield him from tax evasion trial. The six weren’t required to enter any plea and have since been remanded at Kisongo Prison until June 18 when their case will come up for mention. The former DC was brought to the court under tight security. He alighted from a white Landcruiser handcuffed with his co- accused. The six were ordered to squat by plainclothes officers before heading to the court building. Last month, President Samia Suluhu Hassan suspended Mr Sabaya pending investigations over several accusations. Former Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner, Anna Mghwira once warned the former Sambasha Ward councillor over unnecessary arrests. He later appeared on Clouds TV 360 programme as a guest to give details on his performance as the area DC. He also used the opportunity to vindicate some of the allegations levelled against him. The former DC deemed such allegations as “political games.”
