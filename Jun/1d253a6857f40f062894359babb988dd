TANZANIA has been elected vice-president for the upcoming 76th Session of the UN General Assembly from the African States for a one-year term, beginning September 2021. The election was held at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Monday where Tanzania was elected unanimously, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East Africa Cooperation yesterday. “Tanzania was UNGA Vice-President for the last time in 1991,” said the statement in part. During the election, Maldives’ Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdulla Shahid, was elected President of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 76) by 143 votes against his opponent former Afghan Foreign Minister Zalmai Rassoul who scooped 48 votes. The role of the UNGA vice-president is to assist the president in coordinating and overseeing the activities of the UNGA and its committees in drafting resolutions. The UN General Assembly is the main policy and legislative body with the representation of all member states. This year’s meeting is expected to be held in September. Tanzania served as UNGA President in 1979 at the 34th meeting, when Ambassador Dr Salim Ahmed Salim was the country’s representative. In another development, Tanzania has been elected Member of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) for a period of three years with effect from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. “Tanzania has scooped 182 votes out of 186 which were cast by 54 member countries that form the UN,” said the statement. This is the fifth time Tanzania holds the position, where the last time was in 2004 - 2006. Previously the country held the position in 1966 - 1969; 1978 - 1980; and 1994 - 1996. ECOSOC is the agency responsible for UN Economic Development projects, especially in implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, and also oversees Specialized Agencies and Commissions such as UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF.
