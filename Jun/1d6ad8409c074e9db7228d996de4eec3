THE Secretary General of the East African Community (EAC), Dr Peter Mathuki has appealed to the European Union (EU) member states to lift sanctions against the Republic of Burundi, noting that the country had opened a new page and was ready to move forward. Dr Mathuki said that the EU sanctions on the East African were hurting not only Burundians but the people of the entire region. "I appeal to the EU that we work together and open a new page for the betterment of the people of the Republic of Burundi," said Dr Mathuki. Speaking during a high level discussion with the EU Delegation to Tanzania on how to enhance EU support to the integration process in East Africa, Dr Mathuki underscored the importance of EU to work with the region as a bloc, thereby enabling the Community attain its objectives in the integration process.
