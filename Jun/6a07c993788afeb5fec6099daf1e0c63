THE European Union in collaboration with the United Nations and the government of Tanzania have launched a new program on clean cooking solution worth 30million Euros seeking to promote sustainable environment in the country. EU Representative, Ambassador Manfredo Fanti said on Saturday in Dodoma at the commemoration of the World Environment Day. He said the main reason is to help reduce air pollution by conserving the environment. “The objective is to reduce the use of charcoal which is polluting the air and destroying forest. This is a much more sustainable way,” he said. The European Union representative says the union is willing to help the country and the people especially in villages confront the effects of climate change. Mr Manfredo urged the delegates to embark on a campaign to raise awareness of the climate change. “We are launching a public awareness campaign running through October with exhibitions at the European Union,” he noted.
