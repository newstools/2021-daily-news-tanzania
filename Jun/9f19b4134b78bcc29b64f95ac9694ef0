THE Lyamungo Agricultural Marketing Co-operative Society (Lyamungo Amcos) is planning to introduce organic coffee and other organic crops farming with the intention of increasing more markets and income to its members. Speaking during a special meeting to discuss the cooperative society’s revenues income and expenditure here recently, Lyamungo Amcos Chairperson Gabriel Ollomi said preparations were underway to have the introduction of organic coffee and organic crops rolled out. “We have already begun preparations to establish organic farming including the organic coffee which is now in high demand and has reasonably prices in the international coffee market”, he said. The move, according to Mr Ollomi will enable coffee farmers to get better prices, thus, improving their livelihoods, boosting the economic status of the district, the region and the nation at large. He further revealed that the Amcos had already started training farmers to provide education on organic farming but had to suspend the exercise due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Mr Ollomi was optimistic that the cooperative society was poised to earn a total of 220mn/- during the 2021/2022 crop season, compared to 128mn/- that was pocketed by the Amcos in the previous season. The cooperative society, according to Mr Ollomi, had contributed to a number of development activities in the area, including improving the health sector, education; road infrastructure as well as providing incentives for students and teachers, saying the later move helped to improve education among students. “We have set aside 8m/- in facilitating the education of students who cannot afford tuition fees and this has shown great success due to the fact that two students who we sponsored have graduated from universities,” said the chairperson. He added that the Lyamungo Amcos had set aside 30mn/- for the ongoing construction of Lyasikika High School, whereby he said the costs would include installing electrical infrastructure at the learning facility.
