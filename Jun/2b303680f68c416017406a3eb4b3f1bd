TANZANIA Agriculture Development Bank (TADB) has said there is evidence that infrastructure upgrading and capacity building to smallholders in the agriculture, livestock and fisheries sector is proving profitable to producers and the nation. Commenting on TADB’s post-budget commitments relating to livestock, fisheries and agriculture ministries’ approved budgets, TADB Managing Director Japhet Justine, said the past years had proved that infrastructure improvement is increasing smallholders’ incomes and strengthening the national economy. He thanked the Parliament for endorsing the budgets of the two ministries and pledged TADB’s increased support in building and upgrading infrastructure. Mr Justine said that by endorsing the budgets of the two ministries, the national assembly has paved the way for further development of agriculture, livestock and fishery ministries. He explained that the task ahead was to continue building or strengthening the current infrastructure, building the capacity of smallholders and helping producers access to + markets. “The budgets have set goals for the 2021/22 fiscal year to give room for big reforms to be made. Our job as an agriculture bank is to make sure practically these goals are met ,because we have witnessed very encouraging results as a result of infrastructure development and upgrading and capacity building of smallholders in the two ministries,” he said. The Minister for Livestock and Fisheries, Mr Mashimba Ndaki told the Parliament that through concerted efforts in building smallholders’ capacity and infrastructure development, the livestock sector had grown where the number of cattle rose from 33.4 million to 33.9 million, goats from 21.29 to 24.5 million and sheep from 5.65 to 8.5 million
