The government will spend at least 400/- to improve rural roads during the next financial year, according to the Deputy Minister of state, President’s Office Regional Administration and Local Governments, Festo Dugange. He told parliamentarians in Dodoma on Tuesday that the budget is particularly allocated to restore movement of goods and service in remote areas where the infrastructures could be damaged by heavy downpour. Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA) received 275bn/- in 2019/20 for the purpose. The Deputy Minister say the 400bn/- is an increment of nearly 45 percent. “This increase will enable TARURA to renovate the damaged infrastructure in phases,” he said. Additionally, he said that the government is determined to renovate damaged roads by continuously setting aside budget for roads.
