Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has shut down schools and suspended public gatherings as the country faces a surge of infections in a second Covid-19 wave. Public transport between districts will be banned starting Thursday to allow students who are in schools to return home. Bars, cinemas and theatres have also been closed. The suspension of schools and gatherings takes effect from Monday and will be in place for 42 days. Dozens of schools had reported virus cases among staff and students prompting the closure. The announcement came hours after the health ministry announced 1,259 new coronavirus cases - the highest number of infections recorded in a single day - and nine deaths on Sunday. A rise in coronavirus cases was reported two weeks ago and officials mulled over a lockdown to prevent health facilities from being overwhelmed. The national referral hospital Mulago reported a spike in Covid-19 patients last week, saying it needed to increase bed capacity. Uganda has 52,929 cases of coronavirus and 374 deaths so far.
