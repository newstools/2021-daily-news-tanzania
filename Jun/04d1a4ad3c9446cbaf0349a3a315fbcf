The seminar was officiated by the retired President of Zanzibar Dr Amani Abeid Karume who said the elderly need to be involved in sustainable development programs including banks so that they can benefit from their contribution after serving the Nation. Dr Karume called on retirees and other elders relying on pensions to abandon the concept that retirement is the end of life, as living with that concept makes life difficult for them.
