Nigeria will prosecute anyone found to have breached the country's ban on the social media firm Twitter, a government spokesperson has told the BBC. The government announced on Friday it was suspending Twitter's operations in the country. Mobile phone networks blocked access after being ordered to do so, but some users are getting around the ban. The move comes after Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for breaching the site's rules. Some users saw his post, which referred to Nigeria's civil war four decades ago, as a veiled threat towards a secessionist movement in the south-east of the country His government said on Saturday the tweet's removal was "disappointing", but not the only reason for the "temporary" suspension.
