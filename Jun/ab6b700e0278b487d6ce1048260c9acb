AIR Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) owes Zanzibar Airport Authority (ZAA) over 241m/- in unpaid landing and parking fees, the House of Representatives was told here yesterday. Blue Economy and Fisheries Minister Abdallah Hussein Kombo told the house that ATCL and ZAA signed a contract on the landing and parking services, which involved payment of fees. Initially, the public airline used to pay the fee as per contract but later failed, leading to debt accumulation. Minister Kombo, answering a question on behalf of Works, Communications and Transport Minister Rahma Kassim Ali, said the ministry is still pursuing the debt and ATCL has already pledged to settle the outstanding bill soon. The questioner, Mfenesini Representative Machano Othman Said demanded to know the government efforts to help ZAA to have the debt paid, saying the amount has overstayed.
